{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ['## Introduction: Purpose and Scope of LLM Benchmarking\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally reshaped the field of artificial intelligence by enabling machines to process, generate, and understand human language with unprecedented fluency and depth. As these models become central to a growing array of applications—from conversational interfaces and content generation to code synthesis and domain-specific reasoning—the imperative for robust, standardized evaluation becomes increasingly acute. LLM benchmarking reports are emerging as vital instruments to rigorously assess, compare, and communicate the abilities of these complex systems. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the purpose and scope of LLM benchmarking, situating its importance in both the technical evolution of language models and their practical deployment.\n\n### Defining LLM Benchmarking: Concepts and Operational Mechanisms\n\nLLM benchmarking is the standardized, systematic process of evaluating language models using curated tasks, datasets, and metrics. Benchmarking reports synthesize quantitative results and qualitative assessments to deliver actionable insights for developers, researchers, product teams, and decision-makers.\n\n**Core Elements:**\n- **Benchmarks:** Collections of tasks, questions, or scenarios drawn from diverse domains—spanning language understanding, reasoning, factuality, mathematics, coding, and robustness (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K, HumanEval, TruthfulQA).\n- **Evaluation Frameworks:** Methodologies including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned assessments.  \n  - *Zero-shot* evaluations test a model\'s ability to generalize without prior exposure to specific examples.\n  - *Few-shot* scenarios provide limited demonstrations to probe adaptability.\n  - *Fine-tuned* benchmarks assess performance after customizing the model for specific domains.\n- **Metrics:** Quantitative (accuracy, F1, BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity, pass@k, etc.) and qualitative (human or LLM-as-a-judge adequacy, fluency, safety) measures, designed for consistency and reproducibility.\n- **Reporting Structure:** Aggregated scores, leaderboards, detailed breakdowns by task/domain, contextual analyses, and explicit specification of methods and datasets.\n\n### Motivations and Objectives: Why Benchmark LLMs?\n\n#### 1. Standardized Evaluation and Comparison\n\nThe proliferation of LLMs has created a landscape where "apples-to-apples" comparisons are essential yet challenging. Benchmarking reports provide:\n- **Consistent, reproducible metrics** that enable objective comparison across models from different vendors or research labs.\n- **Transparent reporting** that demystifies performance claims, decreasing the impact of marketing bias and selectively curated "success" stories.\n\n#### 2. Informed Model Selection and Deployment\n\nDecision-makers rely on benchmarking data to select models that best fit their operational requirements:\n- **Empirical evidence** for suitability in targeted applications such as customer support, legal reasoning, or code generation.\n- **Leaderboards** and aggregate scores allow practitioners to detect which models excel—e.g., distinguishing a model with superior coding proficiency from one excelling in factual QA.\n\n#### 3. Driving Progress and Innovation\n\nBenchmarking is instrumental in charting the trajectory of LLM development:\n- **Progress tracking** highlights improvements, regressions, and remaining challenges, motivating researchers to address gaps.\n- **Research focus** is sharpened by identifying domain-specific weaknesses (e.g., reasoning, long-form generation) or emergent risks (e.g., bias, hallucination).\n\n#### 4. Establishing Industry Standards\n\nThe establishment of widely adopted benchmarks elevates the entire ecosystem by:\n- **Setting shared standards** for what constitutes strong or safe performance.\n- **Enabling peer review and collaborative validation**, resulting in increased scientific rigor and open innovation.\n\n#### 5. Advancing Responsible and Safe AI\n\nModern benchmarks increasingly assess not just capability, but **robustness, fairness, and safety**:\n- **Tests for adversarial resistance, bias, and toxicity** guide models toward more ethical and reliable behavior.\n- **Domain- and context-specific benchmarks** (e.g., healthcare, finance) foster responsible deployment where stakes are high.\n\n### Scope of LLM Benchmarking Reports: What They Cover\n\n#### Task and Domain Coverage\n\nLLM benchmarking reports typically cover a broad spectrum of linguistic, cognitive, and practical capabilities:\n- **Natural language processing tasks**: summarization, translation, commonsense reasoning.\n- **Specialized domains**: mathematics (GSM8K), programming (HumanEval), factual accuracy (TruthfulQA), safety and robustness (AgentHarm).\n- **Emerging needs**: multimodality, open-ended reasoning, domain-specific compliance (LegalBench, FinBen).\n\n#### Frameworks, Datasets, and Evaluation Protocols\n\n- **Dataset sources:** Static, curated benchmarks vs. dynamic, real-time question generation.\n- **Frameworks:** Use of standardized infrastructures (e.g., Stanford HELM, EleutherAI Harness, LMSys ChatArena) for reproducibility.\n- **Evaluation modes:** Emphasis on both classical (accuracy, perplexity) and scenario-specific metrics.\n\n#### Leaderboards and Aggregated Reporting\n\n- **Public leaderboards** (e.g., Hugging Face, LMArena, vals.ai) aggregate scores and allow stakeholders to monitor progress and marketplace competition over time, with detailed breakdowns available for deep dives.\n\n#### Communication and Documentation\n\n- **Stakeholder communication:** Translation of technical results into actionable summaries for technical and non-technical audiences.\n- **Transparency:** Detailed reporting of evaluation protocols, data provenance, and limitations, facilitating independent verification.\n\n### Limitations and Evolving Complexities in LLM Benchmarking\n\nWhile benchmarking serves foundational roles, it is not without significant challenges:\n\n**1. Data Contamination and Overfitting**\n- The overlap between training data and benchmark datasets can skew results, leading to inflated performance not representative of true generalization.\n\n**2. Real-World Applicability**\n- Standardized benchmarks may fail to capture edge cases, out-of-distribution tasks, or the complexity of real deployment scenarios. Custom, domain- or product-specific evaluation is often required for production-grade systems.\n\n**3. Short Benchmark Lifespans**\n- Rapid LLM progress leads to saturation of popular benchmarks, necessitating ongoing development of new, more challenging test suites.\n\n**4. Subjectivity and Cost in Evaluation**\n- Qualitative or human-driven metrics, while nuanced, introduce subjectivity and are resource-intensive. LLM-as-a-judge approaches are emerging but present open questions around reliability and consistency.\n\n**5. Transparency and Commercial Bias**\n- Vendor-produced reports may selectively emphasize favorable benchmarks; thus, open, peer-reviewed, and methodologically transparent benchmarks are vital.\n\n### State of the Art and Emerging Trends\n\n- **Hybrid Evaluation Approaches:** The field is gravitating toward a mix of quantitative rigor and qualitative nuance, combining automated metrics with targeted human assessment.\n- **Domain-specificity:** As adoption expands to regulated sectors (finance, healthcare, law), specialized benchmarks (e.g., FinBen, MultiMedQA) are gaining prominence.\n- **Infrastructure Expansion:** Open-source benchmarking platforms and public leaderboards are democratizing evaluation and broadening participation.\n\n### Role and Limitations: Summary Table\n\n| Purpose                       | Scope                           | Benefits                                   | Limitations                                |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Standardized evaluation       | NLP, reasoning, coding, safety  | Objective, reproducible, transparent       | Data overlap, overfitting, short lifespan  |\n| Model selection               | Domain-specific, multi-domain   | Informs deployment, accelerates comparison | May miss real-world nuances                |\n| Progress tracking             | Static/dynamic/test suites      | Identifies trends, motivates innovation    | Not universally applicable                 |\n| Industry standard/competition | Leaderboards, disclosure        | Promotes fairness, trust, transparency     | Need for customization, transparency       |\n| Safe/responsible AI           | Robustness, bias, harm, misuse  | Guides ethical development                 | Benchmarks must keep pace with field       |\n\n### Contrasting Perspectives and Ongoing Debates\n\n- **Balance of Open vs. Proprietary Evaluation:** Debates linger regarding proprietary benchmarks versus open, community-led evaluation to maximize transparency and innovation.\n- **Benchmarking vs. Real-World Product Evaluation:** LLM benchmarking alone is not a guarantee of end-product quality; bespoke evaluation frameworks are needed for applications integrating LLMs with external systems or data.\n- **Long-term Value and Adaptability:** As foundational models evolve, so too must our benchmarks—requiring a responsive, adaptive ecosystem of both general and custom evaluations.\n\nLLM benchmarking reports, as detailed above, are vital yet dynamic instruments for navigating the fast-evolving landscape of large language models. Their designs, methodologies, and interpretations will continue to evolve in tandem with advances in LLM architectures, applications, and societal expectations, underpinning the responsible, effective, and transparent use of AI technologies.'], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='purpose and scope of LLM benchmarking reports'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llm-benchmarks', title='What Are LLM Benchmarks? - IBM', raw_content='What Are LLM Benchmarks? | IBM\n\n\n\n\n\nMy IBM\n\n\nLog in\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n# What are LLM benchmarks?\n\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ibm.com/think/artificial-intelligence)\n\n25 June 2024\n\nLink copied\n\n## Authors\n\n[Rina Diane Caballar](https://www.ibm.com/think/author/rina-diane-caballar.html)\n\nStaff Writer\n\n[Cole Stryker](https://www.ibm.com/think/author/cole-stryker)\n\nEditorial Lead, AI Models\n\n## What are LLM benchmarks?\n\nLLM benchmarks are standardized frameworks for assessing the performance of [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models). These benchmarks consist of sample data, a set of questions or tasks to test LLMs on specific skills, metrics for evaluating performance and a scoring mechanism.\n\nModels are benchmarked based on their capabilities, such as coding, common sense and reasoning. Other capabilities encompass [natural language processing](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing), including machine translation, question answering and [text summarization](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/text-summarization).\n\nLLM benchmarks play a crucial role in developing and enhancing models. Benchmarks showcase the progress of an LLM as it learns, with quantitative measures that highlight where the model excels and its areas for improvement.\n\nThis in turn guides the [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning) process, which helps LLM researchers and developers advance the field. LLM benchmarks also provide an objective comparison of different models, helping inform software developers and organizations as they choose which models better suit their needs.\n\n## How LLM benchmarks work\n\nLLM benchmarks operate in a straightforward manner. They supply a task that an LLM must accomplish, evaluate model performance according to a certain metric and produce a score based on that metric. Here’s how each step works in detail:\n\n### Setting up\n\nLLM benchmarks already have sample data prepared—coding challenges, large documents, math problems, real-world conversations, science questions. A range of tasks are also at the ready, including commonsense reasoning, problem-solving, question answering, summary generation and translation. These are all given to the model at the outset of testing.\n\n### Testing\n\nWhen running the benchmark, it’s introduced to a model in one of three approaches:\n\n- [Few-shot](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/few-shot-learning): Before prompting an LLM to perform a task, it’s supplied with a small number of examples showing how to fulfill that task. This demonstrates a model’s ability to learn given scarce data.\n- [Zero-shot](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/zero-shot-learning): An LLM is prompted to complete a task without having seen any examples beforehand. This unveils a model’s ability to comprehend new concepts and adapt to novel scenarios.\n- Fine-tuned: A model is trained on a dataset akin to what the benchmark uses. The goal is to boost the LLM’s command of the task associated with the benchmark and optimize its performance in that specific task.\n\n### Scoring\n\nOnce tests are done, an LLM benchmark computes how close a model’s output resembles the expected solution or standard answer, then generates a score between 0 and 100.\n\n![3D design of balls rolling on a track](/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/pm/ul/g/5a/6e/trailv2_1200x1200.component.think-ad-xl.ts=1746554193743.jpeg/content/experience-fragments/adobe-cms/us/en/site-v2/think-hub/article/_8_column_general_ad/blueprint---think-ad---xf---do-not-modify/artificialintelligence-article-newsletter/_jcr_content/root/think_ad_copy/image)\n\n### The latest AI News + Insights\n\nDiscover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.\n\n[Subscribe today](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=news-urx-52954)\n\n## Key metrics for benchmarking LLMs\n\nBenchmarks apply different metrics to evaluate the performance of LLMs. Here are some common ones:\n\n- **Accuracy or precision** calculates the percentage of correct predictions.\n- **Recall**, also called the sensitivity rate, quantifies the number of true positives—the actual correct predictions.\n- The **F1 score** blends both accuracy and recall into one metric. It considers the two measures to be of equal weight to balance out any false positives or false negatives. F1 scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 signifying excellent recall and precision.\n- **Exact match** is the proportion of predictions an LLM matches exactly and is a valuable criteria for translation and question answering.\n- **Perplexity** measures how good a model is at prediction. The lower an LLM’s perplexity score, the better it is at comprehending a task.\n- **Bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU)** evaluates machine translation by computing the matching n-grams (a sequence of n-adjacent text symbols) between an LLM’s predicted translation and a human-produced translation.\n- **Recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE)** evaluates text summarization and has several types. ROUGE-N, for instance, does similar calculations as BLEU for summaries, while ROUGE-L computes the longest common subsequence between the predicted summary and the human-produced summary.\n\nOne or more of these quantitative metrics are usually combined for a more comprehensive and robust assessment.\n\nMeanwhile, human evaluation involves qualitative metrics such as coherence, relevance and semantic meaning. Human assessors examining and scoring an LLM can make for a more nuanced assessment, but it can be labor intensive, subjective and time consuming. Therefore, a balance of both quantitative and qualitative metrics is needed.\n\nAI Academy\n\n### Why foundation models are a paradigm shift for AI\n\nLearn about a new class of flexible, reusable AI models that can unlock new revenue, reduce costs and increase productivity, then use our guidebook to dive deeper.\n\n[Go to episode](https://www.ibm.com/think/videos/ai-academy/foundation-models-paradigm-shift)\n\n## Limitations of LLM benchmarks\n\nWhile benchmarks are solid indicators of LLM performance, they can’t predict how well a model will operate in the real world. Here are a few constraints of LLM benchmarks:\n\nBounded scoring\n\n\nOnce a model reaches the highest possible score for a certain benchmark, that benchmark will need to be updated with more difficult tasks to make it a useful measure.\n\nBroad dataset\n\n\nSince LLM benchmarks use sample data derived mostly from a broad range of subjects and a wide array of tasks, they may not be a fitting metric for edge scenarios, specialized areas or specific use cases.\n\nFinite assessments\n\n\nLLM benchmarks can only test a model’s current skills. But as LLMs advance and novel capabilities emerge, new benchmarks will have to be created.\n\nOverfitting\n\n\nIf an LLM is trained on the same dataset as the benchmark, it could lead to [overfitting](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/overfitting), wherein the model might perform well on the test data but not on real-world data. This results in a score that doesn’t reflect an LLM’s actual abilities.\n\n## What are LLM leaderboards?\n\nLLM leaderboards publish a ranking of LLMs based on a variety of benchmarks. Leaderboards provide a way to keep track of the myriad LLMs and compare their performance. LLM leaderboards are especially beneficial in making decisions on which models to use.\n\nEach benchmark typically has its own leaderboard, but independent LLM leaderboards also exist. For instance, Hugging Face has a collection of leaderboards, one of which is an open LLM leaderboard that ranks multiple open-source models based on the ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA and Winogrande benchmarks.\n\n## Common LLM benchmarks\n\nResearchers classify LLM benchmarks according to these two aspects:1\n\n- **Assessment criteria:**\xa0LLM evaluation metrics can either be ground truth or human preferences.\xa0**Ground truth**\xa0refers to information assumed to be true, while\xa0**human preferences**\xa0are choices reflecting real-world usage.\n- **Source of questions:**\xa0Prompts can come from either static or live sources. **Static** prompts contain predefined questions, while **live** prompts are questions made in an interactive environment.\n\nBenchmarks can fall into one or more of these categories. Here’s how some popular benchmarks work:\n\n### AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)\n\nARC measures an LLM’s question answering and reasoning abilities through a series of more than 7,000 grade-school natural science questions. These questions are divided into an easy set and a challenge set. Scoring is simple, with a model getting one point for each correct answer and 1/N points if it provides multiple answers and one of those is correct.2\n\n### Chatbot Arena\n\nChatbot Arena is an open benchmark platform that pits two anonymous chatbots against each other. Users have random real-world conversations with both chatbots in an “arena,” then cast votes on which one they prefer, after which the models’ identities are revealed. This crowdsourced pairwise comparison data is fed into statistical methods that estimate scores and create approximate rankings for various LLMs. Sampling algorithms are also used to pair models.1\n\n### Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K)\n\nGSM8K tests an LLM’s mathematical reasoning skills. It has a corpus of 8,500 grade-school math word problems. Solutions are collected in the form of natural language instead of mathematical expressions. AI verifiers are trained to evaluate model solutions.3\n\n### HellaSwag\n\nHellaSwag is an acronym for “Harder Endings, Longer contexts and Low-shot Activities for Situations With Adversarial Generations.” This benchmark is centered around commonsense reasoning and natural language inference. Models are tasked with completing sentences by choosing from a number of possible endings. These endings include wrong answers created through adversarial filtering, an algorithm that generates realistic yet deceptively incorrect answers. HellaSwag evaluates accuracy for both few-shot and zero-shot categories.4\n\n### HumanEval\n\nHumanEval assesses an LLM’s performance in terms of [code generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/code-generator), specifically functional correctness. Models are given programming problems to solve and are evaluated based on passing the corresponding unit tests. This is similar to human software developers who test if their code is correct based on passing particular unit tests. The HumanEval benchmark uses its own evaluation metric called pass@k, which is the probability that at least one of the k-generated code solutions for a coding problem passes that problem’s unit tests.5\n\n### Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)\n\nMMLU is a benchmark assessing the breadth of an LLM’s knowledge, the depth of its [natural language understanding](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/nlp-vs-nlu-vs-nlg) and its ability to solve problems based on gained knowledge. MMLU’s dataset encompasses more than 15,000 multiple-choice general knowledge questions across 57 subjects. Evaluation occurs solely in few-shot and zero-shot settings. The MMLU benchmark scores a model’s accuracy in each subject then averages those numbers for a final score.6\n\n### Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP)\n\nMBPP, also known as Mostly Basic Python Problems, is another code generation benchmark. It has a corpus of more than 900 coding tasks. Akin to HumanEval, it assesses functional correctness based on passing a set of test cases. Evaluation happens in few-shot and fine-tuned settings. MBPP uses two metrics: the percentage of problems that are solved by any sample from the model and the percentage of samples solving their respective tasks.7\n\n### MT-Bench\n\nThe researchers behind Chatbot Arena also created MT-Bench, which is designed to test how well an LLM can engage in dialogue and follow instructions. Its dataset consists of open-ended multi-turn questions, with 10 questions each in these eight areas: coding, extraction, knowledge I (STEM), knowledge II (humanities and social sciences), math, reasoning, roleplay and writing. MT-Bench uses the GPT-4 LLM to evaluate the responses of other LLMs.8\n\n### SWE-bench\n\nLike HumanEval, SWE-bench tests an LLM’s [code generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-code-generation) skills, with a focus on issue resolution. Models are tasked with fixing a bug or addressing a feature request in a specific code base. The benchmark’s assessment metric is the percentage of resolved task instances.9\n\n### TruthfulQA\n\nLarge language models have a tendency to [hallucinate](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations), resulting in inaccurate outputs. The TruthfulQA benchmark aims to tackle this by measuring an LLM’s ability to generate truthful answers to questions. Its dataset contains more than 800 questions spanning 38 subjects. TruthfulQA combines human evaluation with the GPT-3 LLM fine-tuned on the BLEU and ROUGE metrics to predict human assessments of informativeness and truthfulness.10\n\n### Winogrande\n\nWinogrande evaluates an LLM’s commonsense reasoning capabilities. It builds upon the original Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) benchmark, with a huge dataset of 44,000 crowdsourced problems that also uses adversarial filtering. Scoring is based on accuracy.11\n\n[Ebook\n\nHow to choose the right foundation model\n\nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\n\nRead the ebook](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-52620)\n\n## Resources\n\n[AI models\n\nExplore IBM Granite\n\nDiscover IBM® Granite™, our family of open, performant and trusted AI models, tailored for business and optimized to scale your AI applications.

Key metrics and limitations\n====================================================\n\nWith dozens of large language model (LLM) families and hundreds of versions available, choosing the right one can be a daunting task. That’s where LLM evaluation benchmarks step in. Read on to learn about the most popular examples of LLM benchmarks, how they work, and, most importantly, how you can use them to find the language model of your dreams.\n\n![Image 3: LLM agents explained](https://ic.nordcdn.com/v1/https://sb.nordcdn.com/transform/5fa5993c-104e-442f-930f-02f6bab17ec6/nexos-blog-featured-image-4-968x507?X-Nord-Credential=T4PcHqfACi8Naxvulzf4IE8XT4oypRTi0blOOGwbK2A8L4fcPw52k3qkvbkYH&X-Nord-Signature=yVIcRpVoyP1Uz3kNY9aXxbgom0VN8fkdGfPLxPx%2FyfM%3D)\n\n3/3/2025\n\n17 min read\n\n![Image 4: blog author Karolis](https://ic.nordcdn.com/v1/https://sb.nordcdn.com/transform/501d002b-b680-49c3-9bc8-32c7e2e5c12c/blog-author-Karolis?X-Nord-Credential=T4PcHqfACi8Naxvulzf4IE8XT4oypRTi0blOOGwbK2A8L4fcPw52k3qkvbkYH&X-Nord-Signature=4CfwuRwyU4LiXfYX8NcmspA98kcdsFLvuwh2SSsPD60%3D)\n\nKarolis Pilypas Liutkevičius\n\n![Image 5: message bot](https://ic.nordcdn.com/v1/https://sb.nordcdn.com/m/690008f889530ce8/original/message-bot.svg)\n\nnexos.ai experts\n\n1/20/2025\n\n15 min read\n\nWhat are LLM benchmarks?\n------------------------\n\nLLM benchmarks are **standardized tests and frameworks used to evaluate and compare the performance of large language models** across various domains. They consist of specific Benchmarking also lets you see if you will need more than one AI model for your projects. In such cases, using an AI orchestration platform like nexos.ai can be beneficial.datasets, tasks (such as language understanding, question-answering, math problem-solving, and coding), and scoring systems that measure whether models can produce correct responses to given inputs. Thanks to defined metrics, benchmarks help measure a model’s strengths, limitations, and reliability.\n\nMoreover, LLM benchmarks serve as essential **tools for model development and selection** by providing consistent, uniform evaluation methods that enable fair comparisons across different models. They guide the fine-tuning process by offering quantitative measures highlighting where models excel and need improvement, helping researchers advance the field.\n\nAdditionally, benchmarks **help software developers and organizations make informed decisions** when choosing models for their specific needs, as they provide objective model performance data across standardized tests rather than relying on subjective assessments.\n\nHow do LLM benchmarks work?\n---------------------------\n\nLLM benchmarks work in three steps:\n\n1.   1.**Dataset preparation and task presentation** \n2.   2.**Performance evaluation and scoring mechanisms** \n3.   3.**Ranking and leaderboard systems** \n\nLet\'s break down each stage to understand how this works in practice.\n\n### 1. Dataset preparation and task presentation\n\n**LLM benchmarks require datasets containing diverse challenges tailored to specific skills**. These might include coding problems, mathematical equations, reading comprehension passages, scientific questions, or real-world conversation scenarios. The tasks themselves span multiple categories such as commonsense reasoning, problem-solving, question answering, text summarization, and language translation.\n\nWhen administering these tests, benchmarks typically use one of three methodologies:\n\n**Zero-shot** testing presents tasks to the model without giving any examples. This shows the LLM\'s ability to understand new concepts and adapt to unfamiliar scenarios on the fly.\n\n**Few-shot** testing provides a handful of examples before asking the model to complete similar tasks. Such testing is suitable for demonstrating how well the LLM can learn from limited data.\n\n**Fine-tuned evaluation** process involves training the model on datasets similar to the benchmark\'s content. This way, one can optimize LLM’s performance for a specific task type.\n\nThe number of test cases varies significantly by benchmark, ranging from dozens to thousands of examples. Each input requires the model to process information and generate appropriate responses.\n\n### 2. Performance evaluation and scoring mechanisms\n\nAfter models complete their assigned tasks, benchmarks use various evaluation methods and scoring mechanisms depending on the nature of the challenge.\n\nThese range **from simple accuracy metrics** where the LLM has to answer multiple-choice questions to scenarios where we use a **second LLM as a judge** and assesses multiple criteria. In some cases, **human evaluation** can also be used, especially when talking about chatbots.\n\nFinally, evaluation and scoring mechanisms can be combined to provide a more all-around assessment.\n\n### 3. Ranking and leaderboard systems\n\nAfter multiple models complete the same benchmark, their scores enable direct performance comparisons through ranking systems. Individual benchmarks often maintain their own leaderboards, typically published alongside the original research introducing the evaluation framework.\n\nAdditionally, **LLM comparison benchmark leaderboards**, such as those gathered in HuggingFace’s Big Benchmarks Collection, aggregate results from multiple evaluation sources, providing broader performance perspectives.\n\nThese **ranking systems usually provide scores from 0 to 100**, creating standardized performance snapshots that help researchers, developers, and organizations make informed decisions about model selection and development priorities.\n\nWhy is LLM benchmarking important?\n----------------------------------\n\nLLM benchmarking is important because it **helps orient in an ever-growing selection of models**. Without **standardized evaluation**, navigating the landscape full of unverified claims and inconsistent testing would be difficult, to say the least.\n\n### Objective model comparison\n\nThe main benefit of LLM benchmarking is **objective model comparison**. Instead of relying on user reviews and marketing copy, one can see how each model performs under uniform testing conditions. This is especially important because each LLM has its strengths and weaknesses, and using one for all your tasks can be counterproductive.\n\n### Informed decision-making\n\nLLM benchmarks can **help organizations decide which model to choose**. A software development company might want the best option for coding, while an eshop might be looking for the right customer support chatbot. Benchmarking also lets you see if you will need more than one AI model for your projects. In such cases, using an [all-in-one AI platform for business](https://nexos.ai/) can be beneficial. With it, you can also compare the output of different LLMs and choose the best option.\n\n### Driving innovation and improvement\n\nBenchmarks serve as **progress indicators**, providing quantitative data on where different models excel or struggle. So if a certain LLM scores high in coding tasks but lags behind in creative writing, its developers can act accordingly. It’s also beneficial to see how your competitors are doing and what techniques or solutions bring the best results.\n\n### Establishing industry standards\n\nModel benchmarks also **set the bar** for every player. They also provide **transparency** and encourage developers to share performance data, which fuels the competition and benefits the end-user. As soon as one model gets the highest score, that calls for a new benchmark, pushing the evolution further.\n\nWhat are the most common LLM benchmarks?\n----------------------------------------\n\nThere are already plenty of LLM benchmarks available, and more seem to be popping up as the AI technology advances. At the same time, others get retired when they can no longer evaluate the latest models’ responses properly.\n\nHere are some of the most popular and latest LLM benchmarks that are still active in 2025, in alphabetical order.\n\n### AgentHarm\n\nAgentHarm benchmark examines **AI model misuse**. It evaluates how LLMs identify and prevent potential harmful actions by testing 44 behaviors in 8 categories, such as fraud or harassment. To score high, models must refuse malevolent requests and maintain their capabilities after the attack.\n\nAs of now, Meta’s Llama 3.1 has the top position in the AgentHarm benchmark.\n\n### American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME)\n\nAIME is an invite-only **math competition for high school students**. It includes 15 questions that include algebra, geometry, and number theory, where the answer is a single number from 0 to 999. Historically, students answer just one-third of those correctly.\n\nThis benchmark used questions from the 2024 and 2025 competitions. ChatGPT o3 Mini was the leader, with a solid 86.5% accuracy.\n\n### ARC-AGI-2\n\nThe Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge (ARC-AGI-2) got its latest update in March 2025. It tests using the few-shot method and aims to accelerate the creation of Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI. This benchmark involves **symbolic interpretation** and requires recognizing the meaning beyond their visual patterns.\n\nARC-AGI-2 also tests **compositional reasoning,** where LLMs need to apply rules simultaneously or rules that interact with each other.\n\nFinally, it benchmarks **contextual rule application** when they must be applied differently depending on the situation.\n\nAs of June 2025, the leading model in the ARC-AGI-2 was Claude Opus 4.\n\n### Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL)\n\nBFCL is a benchmark used to test LLMs’ ability of **function relevance detection and calling**. The dataset consists of more than 2,000 questions in Python, Java, and other coding languages. BFCL also measures [AI hallucinations](https://nexos.ai/blog/ai-hallucination/).\n\nAt the moment of writing this blog post, xLAM-2-70b by Salesforce had the best score among models with native support for function calling. In the prompt category, GTP-4o turned out to be the leader, taking the 6th place overall.\n\n### CaseLaw\n\nCaseLaw benchmark evaluates how LLMs can be used for **litigation** in relation to public court systems. It uses data from Canadian court cases and two question types. Extractive questions are verified to match the ground truth, while summative questions include the most relevant semantic points.\n\nWhen checking the latest leaderboard, updated on May 30, 2025, we saw Grok 3 beta as the best-performing model, which also offered the best speed.\n\n### FinBen\n\nThe FinBen benchmark was created to evaluate LLMs in **real-world financial scenarios**. It has 24 tasks covering domains such as risk management, forecasting, and decision-making. FinBen also uses two open-source datasets focused on stock trading and financial QA.\n\nAccording to the leaderboard, GPT-4 and Llama 3.1 did the best job.\n\n### Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark (GPQA)\n\nGPQA is one of the hardest tests for measuring **reasoning and general question-answering performance**. The models have to answer complex science questions from STEM disciplines that are Google-proof, meaning they cannot be answered by recalling or web search.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, ChatGPT\'s o3 was at the top of the leaderboard on the vals.ai website. In general, all “reasoning” models performed well in GPQA.\n\n### GSM8K-Platinum\n\nGSM8K has long been the key benchmark designed to test **mathematical reasoning**. In March 2025, the Platinum version replaced its parent model with a goal to reduce the label noise and improve the test\'s reliability. A more precise version showed drastically different results, putting Claude Sonnet 3.7 into the leader’s position.\n\n### Humanity’s Last Exam\n\nA benchmark with the most dramatic name, Humanity’s Last Exam, surely pushes models to the limit in terms of **technical knowledge and reasoning,** and is considered one of the best LLM benchmarks. The dataset includes more than 2,500 challenging questions from over 100 subjects prepared by professors, researchers, and other experts.\n\nAccording to the latest data (April 2025), Gemini 2.5 Pro is at the top of the leaderboard (21.6%), followed by ChatGPT o3 (20.3%) and o4-mini (18.1%). While neither LLM has shown good accuracy, the creators of the benchmark predict that we might see it reach 50% by the end of 2025.\n\n### LiveCodeBench\n\nAs the name implies, LiveCodeBench is tailored to test how LLMs solve **real coding cases** from LeetCode, AtCoder, and Codeforces. The latest benchmark consists of over 1,000 questions and evaluates syntax generation, algorithm design, and code efficiency, among other factors.\n\nAccording to the vals.ai leaderboard updated on June 16, 2025, ChatGPT’s o4 Mini is the ultimate leader in all three performance, budget, and speed categories.\n\n### LMArena\n\nPreviously known as Chatbot Arena, LMArena differs from most benchmarks because the **evaluation is done by humans**. Two anonymous models answer a prompt, and you get to decide which performed better. Afterwards, the identities of LLMs are revealed.\n\nCurrently, LMArena tests models in six areas. Here’s how the leaderboards look:\n\n*   Text – Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview \n*   WebDev – Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview \n*   Vision – Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview \n*   Search – Gemini 2.5 Pro Grounding \n*   Copilot – DeepSeek V2.5 (FIM) \n*   Text-to-image – GPT-Image-1 \n\n### Massive Multimodal Multidiscipline Understanding (MMMU)\n\nMMMU uses complex, college-level tasks from six disciplines and 183 subfields to measure logical **reasoning and perception**. It also includes images, such as diagrams, charts, and maps. MMMU is considered to be one of the most difficult tests in terms of depth and breadth.\n\nGemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT o3 are the two leaders, surpassing even a medium-level human expert. However, the harder MMMU-Pro version puts all three human experts back at the top, with Seed 1.5-VL Thinking as the closest opponent.\n\n### Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)\n\nThe Pro version of MMLU uses more challenging questions to test the complex **reasoning** and **language understanding** of LLMs. It also provides ten possible answers instead of four, reducing the chance of guessing the right one. MMLU includes more than 12,000 questions in 14 domains, such as Biology, Computer Science, History, and Law, requiring extensive world knowledge.\n\nAccording to the vals.ai LLM leaderboard, which was updated on May 30, 2025, Claude Opus 4 is at the top, followed by ChatGPT o3.\n\n### SWE-bench\n\nSWE-bench tests the model’s **real-world coding problem solving** ability. It includes over 2,000 tasks taken from GitHub where the LLM has to modify the code to solve the issue. SWE-bench then runs a Fail-to-Pass test for evaluation.\n\nAs of June 2025, Refact.ai Agent was in the leading position on the Lite version of the benchmark, closely followed by a combo of SWE-agent and Claude 4 Sonnet.\n\nWhat are the key metrics for benchmarking?\n------------------------------------------\n\nThere are plenty of different approaches when it comes to benchmarking AI systems. Here are some of the key metrics:\n\n**Accuracy-based metrics** work best for tasks with definitive correct answers, such as multiple-choice questions. Benchmarks like MMLU (multitask accuracy) calculate the number of correct responses and are typically used to evaluate general model capabilities.\n\n**Recall metric** evaluates the number of relevant items (true positives) the model has found in the full set of correct options.\n\n**F1 score** takes both accuracy and recall into account. A high F1 score means that the model is good at both metrics, while a low score indicates that it’s bad in either accuracy or recall. This metric is used in benchmarks such as SQuAD that deal with natural language processing (NLP).\n\n**Exact match** is a simple metric often used in NLP tasks, such as question answering. As the name implies, it only allows one correct answer. However, factors such as lowercase/uppercase, articles (a, an, the), and punctuation are usually not taken into account.\n\n**Perplexity** is one of the key metrics used in OpenWebText and similar benchmarks. It shows how well a model can predict a sequence of words. A low score means that the LLM is confident and makes accurate predictions. If the score is high, it means that the model chooses from a number of equally likely answers.\n\n**Overlap-based metrics** are used when there can be multiple valid responses. These metrics compare shared words and phrases between the LLM’s output and reference answers. Two common examples are BLEU for machine translation and ROUGE for text summarization.\n\n**Functional evaluation** process applies to coding benchmarks, such as HumanEval. This benchmark, developed by OpenAI, includes Python coding tasks and evaluates the chance that at least one of the model’s generated code samples passes the unit tests.\n\n**AI-powered evaluation** represents an approach where we use an LLM as a judge to assess response quality based on criteria like truthfulness, helpfulness, or human preference alignment.\n\n**Human evaluation** offers a more qualitative approach, taking into account metrics such as semantic meaning or relevance. One of the most well-known benchmarks of this type is LMArena, where users do a blind test comparing two large language models.\n\nTo sum up, each benchmark usually has its own evaluation metric or metrics based on the methodology used.\n\nWhat are the limitations of LLM benchmarking?\n---------------------------------------------\n\nEven though LLM benchmarks provide valuable information about most models and their capabilities, they do have some limitations. Knowing these will help you avoid over-relying on benchmarking and make an informed decision about the right model for you.\n\n### Restricted scope and focus on known capabilities\n\nMost benchmarks test models in areas where they already have capabilities. This leaves a low chance of discovering any new ones. Therefore, traditional benchmarking cannot grasp the full potential of LLMs.\n\n### Short lifespan\n\nBenchmarks become outdated quickly and lose relevance as soon as any LLM achieves a near-perfect or human-level score. This calls for new benchmarks, but the rapid improvement of the models forces us to play a never-ending catch-up game.\n\n### Data contamination\n\nData contamination happens when benchmark data unintentionally appears in the LLM’s training data because of data crawls or other reasons. In this case, the model might simply “remember” the correct answer instead of actually solving the problem.\n\n### Overfitting\n\nOverfitting occurs when the models are trained on data similar to that of the benchmark. It can also happen when the LLM is being trained for too long on a dataset that’s too small. In such a case, the model might memorize the answers and show a high score but perform poorly in real-world scenarios.\n\n### Limited real-world applicability\n\nEven the best benchmarks struggle to simulate all possible scenarios of LLM usage, even when testing in specific areas like coding. As a result, a high-scoring model might still struggle when applied in practice.\n\n### Not fit for edge cases\n\nWhile there are plenty of benchmarks for different tasks, they don’t cover all niche areas or highly specialized fields. And even if such tests are created, more often than not, they become outdated as even more generic benchmarks struggle to keep up with the LLM model advancements.\n\n### Inadequate for LLM applications\n\nBenchmarks can evaluate the model well, but the same cannot be said for LLM applications that often involve custom datasets and rules. Therefore, if a particular model scores highest in LMArena, that doesn’t mean it’s the best choice for your company’s customer support. In such cases, it’s best to build your own benchmark for evaluating chat assistants and othr AI systems.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThere are multiple benchmarks for testing large language models, and LLM researchers make sure that their numbers continue to grow. While existing benchmarks can show the strengths and limitations of LLMs, the results do not always translate well to the real world. Therefore, we encourage you to look at the LLM leaderboards with a healthy dose of skepticism because, ultimately, the best model is not the number one overall but the number one for you.\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### How do models score on LLM benchmarks?\n\n Models score on LLM benchmarks by completing specific tasks like reasoning, coding, or question-answering, then receiving scores (typically 0-100) based on how accurately their responses match expected or "ground truth" answers. \n\n### What are the main LLM coding benchmarks?\n\n As of 2025, the two main LLM coding benchmarks are LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench. The former evaluates models by taking problems from three competitive programming platforms, while the latter provides real-world issues from GitHub. \n\n### What are the main LLM reasoning benchmarks?\n\n As of 2025, the main LLM reasoning benchmarks are ARC-AGI-2, GPQA Diamond, Humanity’s Last Exam, MMMU, and MMLU. They assess different aspects of reasoning, such as symbolic interpretation, perception, and contextual rule application. \n\n### What are the main LLM math benchmarks?\n\n As of 2025, the main LLM math benchmarks are AIME, MGSM, MATH 500, and GSM8K-Platinum. They require advanced algebra, calculus, geometry, statistics, and number theory skills. \n\n### What are the main LLM truthfulness benchmarks?\n\n As of 2025, the main LLM truthfulness benchmarks are GPQA and MMLU.

Among them are the giants: Mistral 7 billion, Mixtral 8x7 billion, Llama 70 billion, and the colossal Falcon 180 billion. Yet, there also exist models like Phi1, Phi1.5, and Falcon 1B, striving for similar prowess with a leaner framework of 1 to 4 billion parameters. Each model, big or small, shares a common goal: to master the art of language, excelling in tasks like summarization, question-answering, and named entity recognition.\n\nBut across all of these cases, Large Language Models (LLMs) universally share some very flawed behaviors:\n\nIt is evident that merely training LLMs is not sufficient. Thus, the question arises: How can we confidently assert that LLM \'A\' (with \'n\' number of parameters) is superior to LLM \'B\' (with \'m\' parameters)? Or is LLM \'A\' more reliable than LLM \'B\' based on quantifiable, reasonable observations?\n\nThere needs a standard to benchmark LLMs, ensuring they are ethically reliable and factually performant. Although a lot of research has been done on benchmarking (eg. [MMLU, HellaSwag, BBH, etc.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-benchmarks-mmlu-hellaswag-and-beyond)), merely researching is also not enough for robust, customized benchmarking for production use cases.\n\nThis article provides a bird\'s-eye view of current research on LLM evaluation, along with some outstanding open-source implementations in this area. In this blog you will learn:\n\n## **Scenario, Task, Benchmark Dataset, and Metric**\n\nâ\x80\x9cScenarioâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cTaskâ\x80\x9d, â\x80\x9cBenchmark Datasetâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cMetricâ\x80\x9d are some frequently used terms in the evaluation space, so it is extremely important to understand what they mean before proceeding.\n\n#### **ScenarioÂ**\n\nA scenario is a broad set of contexts/settings or a condition under which LLMâ\x80\x99s performance is assessed or tested. For example:\n\nSeveral popular benchmarks already exist in the field of LLMs, including [MMLU, HellaSwag, and BIG-Bench Hard for example.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-benchmarks-mmlu-hellaswag-and-beyond)\n\n#### **Task**\n\nAs simple as it sounds, a task can be thought of as a more granular form of a scenario. It is more specific on what basis the LLM is evaluated. A task can be a composition (or a group) of a lot of sub-tasks.Â\n\nFor example, Arithmetic can be considered as a task. Where it clearly mentions it evaluates LLMs on arithmetic questions. Under this, there can be a lot of sub-tasks like Arithmetic Level 1, Level 2, etc. In this example, all the arithmetic sub-tasks (from level 1 to 5) make up the Arithmetic task.Â\n\nSimilarly, we can have Multiple Choice as a task. Under this, we can have Multiple choice on history, algebra, etc., as all the subtasks.Â\xa0In fact, [MMLU is based entirely on multiple choices.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-benchmarks-mmlu-hellaswag-and-beyond#mmlu-massive-multitask-language-understanding-)\n\n#### **Metric**\n\nA metric can be defined as a qualitative measure used to evaluate the performance of a Language Model on certain tasks/scenarios. A metric can be either a simple:\n\nIn fact, you should read this full article if you want to learn [everything about LLMÂ\xa0evaluation metrics](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation). For now, here is a brief overview:\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/678c3a81ed62822230fddc5b_6589c23e646aea108e09f592_1*MMs1uRXuj3UZmBvzJJ3mAA.webp)\n\nThe above figures try to simplify the taxonomy of the classification of different types of metrics used in LLM evaluation. A metric can also be a composition of different atomic/granular metrics. A very simple example is the F1-score which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.Â\n\nSimilarly in NLP, the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a composition of precision, brevity penalty, and N-gram matching.Â\xa0If you wish, you can also club different metrics to come up with a new metric.Â\n\n#### **Benchmark Dataset**\n\nA benchmark dataset is a standardized collection of test sets that is used to evaluate LLMs on a given task or scenario. Here are some examples:\n\nIn most of the cases presented in later sections, you will see that a scenario can often consist of a lot of benchmark datasets. A task might consist of a lot of sub-tasks and each sub-task can consist of a bunch of datasets. But, it can also simply be a task that contain some benchmark dataset under it.\n\n## **Current Research Frameworks for Benchmarking LLMs**\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/678c3a81ed62822230fddc5e_6589c27d205fdc3745c8cbbf_1*B5WkW7DCQyubFgZH5LBzIg.webp)\n\nIn this section we are going to look into various benchmarking frameworks, and what they offer. Please note: right now there is no standardization in naming conventions. It might sound very confusing when understanding this for the first time, so bear with me.Â\n\n#### **Language Model Evaluation Harness (by EleutherAI)**\n\n[Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) provides a unified framework to benchmark LLMs on a large number of evaluation **tasks**. I intentionally highlighted the word task, because, there is **NO** such concept of scenarios in Harness (I will use Harness instead of LM Evaluation Harness).\n\nUnder Harness, we can see many tasks, which contains different **subtasks**. Each task or set of subtasks, evaluates an LLM on different areas, like generative capabilities, reasoning in various areas, etc.Â\n\nEach subtask under a task (or even sometimes the task itself) has a benchmark dataset and the tasks are generally associated with some prominent research done on evaluation. Harness puts a great effort into unifying and structuring all those datasets, configs, and evaluation strategies (like the metrics associated with evaluating the benchmark datasets), all in one place.Â\n\nNot only that, Harness also supports different kinds of LLM backends (for example: VLLM, GGUF, etc). It enables huge customizability on changing prompts and experimenting with them.Â\n\nThis is a small example of how you can easily evaluate the [Mistral model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) on the [HellaSwag task](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rowan/hellaswag) (a task to judge the common sense capability of an LLM).\n\n`lm_eval --model hf \\\n--model_args pretrained=mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 \\\n--tasks hellaswag \\\n--device cuda:0 \\\n--batch_size 8`\n\nInspired by LM Evaluation Harness, there is another framework called [BigCode Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcode-evaluation-harness) by the BigCode project that tries to provide similar API and CLI methods to evaluate LLMs specifically for code generation tasks. Since evaluation for code generation is a very specific topic, we can discuss that in the next blog, so stay tuned!\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Confident AI:Â\xa0TheÂ\xa0DeepEval LLMÂ\xa0Evaluation Platform\n\nThe leading platform to evaluate and test LLMÂ\xa0applications on the cloud, native to DeepEval.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/661106881e9d2d02f5060281_maximize.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/67d56572dc72582cf7e7f90a_confident-red.svg)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Got Red?

A scenario consists of:\n\nHELM then tries to prioritize a subset of scenarios and metrics based on societal relevance (e.g. scenarios considering reliability on user-facing applications), coverage (multi-lingually), and feasibility (i.e. evaluation where a computed optimal significant subset of the task is chosen, instead of running all the datapoints one by one.)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/678c3a82ed62822230fddc9f_6589c2b66be41e89a38cc3dd_0*MMRekOY98BpG3C-I.webp)\n\nNot only that, this HELM tries to cover a set of 7 metrics (Accuracy, Calibration, Robustness, Fairness, Bias, Toxicity, and Efficiency) for almost all the scenarios, because mere accuracy cannot provide the utmost reliability on LLM performance.\n\n#### PromptBench (by Microsoft)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/678c3a82ed62822230fddca8_6589c2d46be41e89a38cd0ed_0*sivmGa453ewMwMOQ.webp)\n\n[PromptBench](https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench?tab=readme-ov-file) is another unified library for benchmarking LLMs. Very similar to HELM and Harness, it supports different LLM frameworks (for example: Hugging Face, VLLM, etc). What sets it apart from other frameworks is that other than just evaluating tasks, it also supports evaluating different Prompt Engineering methods and evaluates LLMs on different prompt-level adversarial attacks. We can also construct pipelines of different evaluations that make production-level use cases easier.\n\n#### ChatArena (by LMSys)\n\nUnlike previous benchmarking frameworks, this framework tries to approach the benchmarking problem differently. This benchmark platform features anonymous, randomized battles of different LLMs on specific prompts and user votes which LLM (keeping it anonymous) did the job better.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66c35d2113c170ab233c71a1_6589c2e9ea0b9ace55c0a270_1*R9uC7xsFERRygyrBjSUpfw.webp)\n\nAs you can see in the image above, you can start with your prompt and two anonymous LLMs (Model A and B). Both the models give some answer then you choose which model did better. Super simple and intuitive, nothing fancy. However, it does an awesome job of quantifying LLM performance. The quantification of comparison is done through Maximum Likelihood Estimation Elo (MLE-Elo) ratings (a.k.a [Bradley-Terry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model) model).\n\nLmSys also provides a leaderboard where different major LLMs are ranked based on the MLE-Elo ratings. You can check that out [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard).\n\n## Still, Problems with Benchmarking LLMs Remain\n\nUp until now, we dived into some awesome research and their various implementations. We learnt:\n\nHowever, These systems are consisted of lots of different moving components, like vector databases, orchestration of different LLM workloads (a.k.a agents), prompt engineering, data for fine-tuning, etc., is a pain to manage.\n\nAnother problem we have is the distinction in research and production evaluation. Building and fine-tuning LLMs rapidly and shipping to production is not an easy task, and ignoring the cost and inference optimization, production-grade evaluation infrastructure is another important bottleneck. Let me explain in more detail.\n\nAs we all can agree on, testing is an important part and parcel of classical rapid software development (eg., in Python, PyTest plays an important role in testing), and is also used in CI/CD pipelines before shipping newer updates to software, and hence development process becomes streamlined and reliable.\n\nHowever, we do not have a Pytest-like testing infrastructure for LLMs. Even if we have something like that, LLMs are probabilistic machines, which makes defining deterministic test cases inadequate. A thorough testing in real-time and stress testing (red teaming) is also important. But, that kind of thing is also not present right now at scale, which hinders the process of building production-grade Gen AI products.\n\nSince LLMs need to be continuously fine-tuned, which are later used to develop LLM systems (for example RAG based systems), you need infrastructure that:\n\nNow at this point, if you are thinking that harness or HELM can be very useful, then you are right and wrong at the same time. Although HELM and Harness are providing users a huge leap towards evaluating LLMs, all of these libraries have shadow interfaces (API interfaces that are not mentioned properly in the documentation) and mostly use or run through CLI, which is not ideal for the rapid prototyping of models.\n\nLastly, we might require very domain-specific evaluations that is out-of-scope of these current benchmarking frameworks. Writing those evaluations should be as easy as writing test cases for PyTest, and the same goes for benchmarking LLMs, which these frameworks do not currently support.\n\n## Best Practices in Benchmarking LLMs\n\nAlthough this whole field is very much new, we are seeing and emerging trend that practitioners are mostly using LLMs for very specific use cases such as text summarization, QA on internal knowledge bases, and data extraction. In most cases, LLMs need to be benchmarked on how faithful they are, and also they need to be benchmarked on how accurate they are in the domain on which they will be deployed.\n\nSo, a typical development lifecycle:\n\nThe above set of processes can be divided into two phases.\n\n#### Pre-Production Evaluation\n\nDuring this initial exploration phase, we can experiment with each of the following combinations:\n\nSince working with LLMs is a costly business, we need to keep a perfect balance between cost and quality. So experimentation is a huge part of this process. We also need to have proper evaluation infrastructure that:\n\n#### Post-Production Evaluation\n\nOnce LLMs are deployed, here are some very important best practices that can be employed after putting LLM pipelines into production:\n\n## Implementing BestÂ\xa0Practices for LLM Benchmarking\n\nIf you want to practice building a testing framework for LLMs, implementing everything from scratch is a great choice. However, if you want to use an existing robust evaluation framework for LLMs, use [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval), as we\'ve done all the hard work for you already.\n\nDeepEval is the open-source evaluation infrastructure for LLMs, and makes following best practices for evaluation processes as easy as writing test cases in PyTest. Here are the things it offers to solve current problems with benchmarking LLMs:\n\nNot only that, but several new features like integration of LM-Evaluation Harness, and concurrent evaluations during fine-tuning using HuggingFace are coming soon. If you want to understand more about DeepEval, check out the â\xad\x90 [GitHub repo](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) â\xad\x90\n\n`from deepeval import assert_test\nfrom deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\ndef test_hallucination():\nmetric = HallucinationMetric(minimum_score=0.5)\ntest_case = LLMTestcase(input="...", actual_output="...")\nassert_test(test_case, [metric])`\n\nDonâ\x80\x99t forget to give it a star to let us know we\'re moving in the right direction. Also, we have a curated set of [docs](https://docs.confident-ai.com/) and [tutorials](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog) where you can easily get started with DeepEval.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we learned about the current evaluation paradigm and understood terminologies of LLM benchmarking/evaluation. We also learned about some prominent research on evaluating benchmarking and comparing LLMs on various tasks or scenarios. Finally, we discussed the current problems of evaluating LLMs during a production use case and also went through some best practices that can help us overcome the commonly seen production-related issues and deploy LLMs safely and confidently.\n\n## References\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Confident AI:Â\xa0TheÂ\xa0DeepEval LLMÂ\xa0Evaluation Platform\n\nThe leading platform to evaluate and test LLMÂ\xa0applications on the cloud, native to DeepEval.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/661106881e9d2d02f5060281_maximize.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/67d56572dc72582cf7e7f90a_confident-red.svg)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Got Red?

LLMs are trained on [huge sets of data](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/big-data/) — hence the name "large." LLMs are built on [machine learning](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-machine-learning/): specifically, a type of [neural network](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-neural-network/) called a transformer model.\n\nIn simpler terms, an LLM is a computer program that has been fed enough examples to be able to recognize and interpret human language or other types of complex data. Many LLMs are trained on data that has been gathered from the Internet — thousands or millions of gigabytes\' worth of text. Some LLMs continue to [crawl the web](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-web-crawler/) for more content after they are initially trained. But the quality of the samples impacts how well LLMs will learn natural language, so an LLM\'s programmers may use a more curated data set, at least at first.\n\nLLMs use a type of machine learning called [deep learning](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-deep-learning/) in order to understand how characters, words, and sentences function together. Deep learning involves the probabilistic analysis of unstructured data, which eventually enables the deep learning model to recognize distinctions between pieces of content without human intervention.\n\nLLMs are then further trained via tuning: they are fine-tuned or prompt-tuned to the particular task that the programmer wants them to do, such as interpreting questions and generating responses, or translating text from one language to another.\n\nResource\n\nRegain control with the Connectivity Cloud\n\n[Learn more](https://www.cloudflare.com/connectivity-cloud/)\n\nWhat are LLMs used for?\n-----------------------\n\nLLMs can be trained to do a number of tasks. One of the most well-known uses is their application as [generative AI](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-generative-ai/): when given a prompt or asked a question, they can produce text in reply. The publicly available LLM ChatGPT, for instance, can generate essays, poems, and other textual forms in response to user inputs.\n\nAny large, complex data set can be used to train LLMs, including programming languages. Some LLMs can help programmers write code. They can write functions upon request — or, given some code as a starting point, they can finish writing a program. LLMs may also be used in:\n\n*   Sentiment analysis\n*   DNA research\n*   Customer service\n*   [Chatbots](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-chatbot/)\n*   Online search\n\nExamples of real-world LLMs include ChatGPT (from OpenAI), Bard (Google), Llama (Meta), and Bing Chat (Microsoft). GitHub\'s Copilot is another example, but for coding instead of natural human language.\n\nSign Up\n\nBuild and deploy AI applications\n\n[Get started](https://ai.cloudflare.com/?_gl=1*h81vgb*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MTY4OTU4MjAuQ2p3S0NBandnZGF5QmhCUUVpd0FYaE14dG9mSmhOaWRZZTM3Y1ZFVk00MDVkZFAzUGtqYndXZmJJMzJKR0xpSDhxeFBXRnN0cVNpam14b0N4MTRRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_dc*R0NMLjE3MTY4OTU4MjAuQ2p3S0NBandnZGF5QmhCUUVpd0FYaE14dG9mSmhOaWRZZTM3Y1ZFVk00MDVkZFAzUGtqYndXZmJJMzJKR0xpSDhxeFBXRnN0cVNpam14b0N4MTRRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTY3ODY3NjkxLjE3MTYzOTczMzc.*_ga*ODE2NDU0ODk5LjE3MTYzOTczMTU.*_ga_SQCRB0TXZW*MTcxODM3Mjc4Mi4zNzAuMS4xNzE4Mzc0MjAxLjAuMC4w)\n\nHow do large language models work?\n----------------------------------\n\n#### Machine learning and deep learning\n\nAt a basic level, LLMs are built on machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of AI, and it refers to the practice of feeding a program large amounts of data in order to train the program how to identify features of that data without human intervention.\n\nLLMs use a type of machine learning called deep learning. Deep learning models can essentially train themselves to recognize distinctions without human intervention, although some human fine-tuning is typically necessary.\n\nDeep learning uses probability in order to "learn." For instance, in the sentence "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog," the letters "e" and "o" are the most common, appearing four times each. From this, a deep learning model could conclude (correctly) that these characters are among the most likely to appear in English-language text.\n\nRealistically, a deep learning model cannot actually conclude anything from a single sentence. But after analyzing trillions of sentences, it could learn enough to predict how to logically finish an incomplete sentence, or even generate its own sentences.\n\n#### LLM neural networks\n\nIn order to enable this type of deep learning, LLMs are built on neural networks. Just as the human brain is constructed of neurons that connect and send signals to each other, an artificial neural network (typically shortened to "neural network") is constructed of network nodes that connect with each other. They are composed of several "layers”: an input layer, an output layer, and one or more layers in between. The layers only pass information to each other if their own outputs cross a certain threshold.\n\n#### LLM transformer models\n\nThe specific kind of neural networks used for LLMs are called transformer models. Transformer models are able to learn context — especially important for human language, which is highly context-dependent. Transformer models use a mathematical technique called self-attention to detect subtle ways that elements in a sequence relate to each other. This makes them better at understanding context than other types of machine learning. It enables them to understand, for instance, how the end of a sentence connects to the beginning, and how the sentences in a paragraph relate to each other.\n\nThis enables LLMs to interpret human language, even when that language is vague or poorly defined, arranged in combinations they have not encountered before, or contextualized in new ways. On some level they "understand" semantics in that they can associate words and concepts by their meaning, having seen them grouped together in that way millions or billions of times.\n\nWhat are some advantages and limitations of LLMs?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nA key characteristic of LLMs is their ability to respond to unpredictable queries. A traditional computer program receives commands in its accepted syntax, or from a certain set of inputs from the user. A video game has a finite set of buttons, an application has a finite set of things a user can click or type, and a programming language is composed of precise if/then statements.\n\nBy contrast, an LLM can respond to natural human language and use data analysis to answer an unstructured question or prompt in a way that makes sense. Whereas a typical computer program would not recognize a prompt like "What are the four greatest funk bands in history?", an LLM might reply with a list of four such bands, and a reasonably cogent defense of why they are the best.\n\nIn terms of the information they provide, however, LLMs can only be as reliable as the data they ingest. If fed false information, they will give false information in response to user queries. LLMs also sometimes "[hallucinate](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-are-ai-hallucinations/)": they create fake information when they are unable to produce an accurate answer. For example, in 2022 news outlet Fast Company [asked](https://www.fastcompany.com/90819887/how-to-trick-openai-chat-gpt) ChatGPT about the company Tesla\'s previous financial quarter; while ChatGPT provided a coherent news article in response, much of the information within was invented.\n\nIn terms of security, user-facing applications based on LLMs are as prone to bugs as any other application. LLMs can also be manipulated via malicious inputs to provide certain types of responses over others — including responses that are dangerous or unethical. Finally, one of the [security problems with LLMs](https://www.cloudflare.com/the-net/vulnerable-llm-ai/) is that users may upload secure, confidential data into them in order to increase their own productivity. But LLMs use the inputs they receive to further train their models, and they are not designed to be secure vaults; they may expose confidential data in response to queries from other users.\n\nHow developers can quickly start building their own LLMs\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo build LLM applications, developers need easy access to multiple data sets, and they need places for those data sets to live. Both cloud storage and on-premises storage for these purposes may involve infrastructure investments outside the reach of developers\' budgets. Additionally, training data sets are typically stored in multiple places, but [moving that data](https://www.cloudflare.com/the-net/cloud-egress-fees-challenge-future-ai/) to a central location may result in massive [egress fees](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-are-data-egress-fees/).\n\nFortunately, Cloudflare offers several services to allow developers to quickly start spinning up LLM applications, and other types of AI. Vectorize is a globally distributed vector database for querying data stored in no-egress-fee object storage ([R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/)) or documents stored in [Workers Key Value](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/workers-kv/). Combined with the development platform [Cloudflare Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/), developers can use Cloudflare to quickly start experimenting with their own

are LLMs?\n--------------\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are a category of foundation models trained on immense amounts of data making them capable of understanding and generating natural language and other types of content to perform a wide range of tasks.\n\nLLMs have become a household name thanks to the role they have played in bringing generative AI to the forefront of the public interest, as well as the point on which organizations are focusing to adopt artificial intelligence across numerous business functions and use cases.\n\nOutside of the enterprise context, it may seem like LLMs have arrived out of the blue along with new developments in [generative AI](https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI). However, many companies, including IBM, have spent years implementing LLMs at different levels to enhance their natural [language understanding (NLU)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing) and [natural language processing](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing) (NLP) capabilities. This has occurred alongside advances in machine learning, machine learning models, algorithms, neural networks and the transformer models that provide the architecture for these AI systems.\n\nLLMs are a class of [foundation models](https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models), which are trained on enormous amounts of data to provide the foundational capabilities needed to drive multiple use cases and applications, as well as resolve a multitude of tasks. This is in stark contrast to the idea of building and training domain specific models for each of these use cases individually, which is prohibitive under many criteria (most importantly cost and infrastructure), stifles synergies and can even lead to inferior performance.\n\nLLMs represent a significant breakthrough in NLP and [artificial intelligence](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/generative-ai-benefits), and are easily accessible to the public through interfaces like Open AI’s Chat GPT-3 and GPT-4, which have garnered the support of Microsoft. Other examples include Meta’s Llama models and Google’s bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT/RoBERTa) and PaLM models. IBM has also recently launched its [Granite model series](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-09-28-IBM-Announces-Availability-of-watsonx-Granite-Model-Series,-Client-Protections-for-IBM-watsonx-Models) on watsonx.ai, which has become the generative AI backbone for other IBM products like watsonx Assistant and watsonx Orchestrate.\n\nIn a nutshell, LLMs are designed to understand and generate text like a human, in addition to other forms of content, based on the vast amount of data used to train them. They have the ability to infer from context, generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, translate to languages other than English, summarize text, answer questions (general conversation and FAQs) and even assist in creative writing or [code generation tasks](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-code-assistant).\n\nThey are able to do this thanks to billions of parameters that enable them to capture intricate patterns in language and perform a wide array of language-related tasks. LLMs are revolutionizing applications in various fields, from chatbots and virtual assistants to content generation, research assistance and language translation.\n\nAs they continue to evolve and improve, LLMs are poised to reshape the way we interact with technology and access information, making them a pivotal part of the modern digital landscape.\n\n![Image 1: AI brain and network on programming code background.](https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/stock-assets/getty/image/photography/f8/d9/code-brain.component.think-ad-xl.ts=1747761172678.jpg/content/adobe-cms/us/en/think/topics/large-language-models/_jcr_content/root/table_of_contents/body-article-8/think_ad_copy_188453/image)\n\n### How to choose the right foundation model\n\nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\n\n[Read the ebook](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-52620)\n\nHow large language models work\n------------------------------\n\nLLMs operate by leveraging deep learning techniques and vast amounts of textual data. These models are typically based on a transformer architecture, like the generative pre-trained transformer, which excels at handling sequential data like text input. LLMs consist of multiple layers of neural networks, each with parameters that can be fine-tuned during training, which are enhanced further by a numerous layer known as the attention mechanism, which dials in on specific parts of data sets.\n\nDuring the training process, these models learn to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context provided by the preceding words. The model does this through attributing a probability score to the recurrence of words that have been tokenized, broken down into smaller sequences of characters. These tokens are then transformed into embeddings, which are numeric representations of this context.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, this process involves training the LLM on a massive corpora of text (in the billions of pages), allowing it to learn grammar, semantics and conceptual relationships through zero-shot and self-supervised learning. Once trained on this training data, LLMs can generate text by autonomously predicting the next word based on the input they receive, and drawing on the patterns and knowledge they've acquired. The result is coherent and contextually relevant language generation that can be harnessed for a wide range of NLU and content generation tasks.\n\nModel performance can also be increased through prompt engineering, [prompt-tuning](https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-ai-prompt-tuning), fine-tuning and other tactics like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to remove the biases, hateful speech and factually incorrect answers known as “[hallucinations](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations?)” that are often unwanted byproducts of training on so much unstructured data. This is one of the most important aspects of ensuring [enterprise-grade LLMs](https://research.ibm.com/blog/generative-ai-for-enterprise) are ready for use and do not expose organizations to unwanted liability, or cause damage to their reputation.\n\n AI Academy \n\n### Why foundation models are a paradigm shift for AI\n\nLearn about a new class of flexible, reusable AI models that can unlock new revenue, reduce costs and increase productivity, then use our guidebook to dive deeper.\n\n[Go to episode](https://www.ibm.com/think/videos/ai-academy/foundation-models-paradigm-shift)\n\nLLM use cases\n-------------\n\nLLMs are redefining an increasing number of business processes and have proven their versatility across a myriad of use cases and tasks in various industries. They augment conversational AI in chatbots and virtual assistants (like IBM watsonx Assistant and Google’s BARD) to enhance the interactions that underpin excellence in customer care, providing context-aware responses that mimic interactions with human agents.\n\nLLMs also excel in content generation, automating content creation for blog articles, marketing or sales materials and other writing tasks. In research and academia, they aid in summarizing and extracting information from vast datasets, accelerating knowledge discovery. LLMs also play a vital role in language translation, breaking down language barriers by providing accurate and contextually relevant translations. They can even be used to write code, or “translate” between programming languages.\n\nMoreover, they contribute to accessibility by assisting individuals with disabilities, including text-to-speech applications and generating content in accessible formats. From healthcare to finance, LLMs are [transforming industries](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-for-business-benefits) by streamlining processes, improving customer experiences and enabling more efficient and data-driven decision making.\n\nMost excitingly, all of these capabilities are easy to access, in some cases literally an API integration away.\n\nHere is a list of some of the most important areas where LLMs benefit organizations:\n\n*   **Text generation:**language generation abilities, such as writing emails, blog posts or other mid-to-long form content in response to prompts that can be refined and polished. An excellent example is retrieval-augmented generation ([RAG](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG)).\n\n*   **Content summarization:** summarize long articles, news stories, research reports, corporate documentation and even customer history into thorough texts tailored in length to the output format.\n\n*   **AI assistants:** chatbots that answer customer queries, perform backend tasks and provide detailed information in natural language as a part of an integrated, self-serve customer care solution.\n\n*   **Code generation:**assists developers in building applications, finding errors in code and uncovering security issues in multiple programming languages, even “translating” between them.\n\n*   **Sentiment analysis:** analyze text to determine the customer’s tone in order understand customer feedback at scale and aid in brand reputation management.\n\n*   **Language translation:** provides wider coverage to organizations across languages and geographies with fluent translations and multilingual capabilities.\n\nLLMs stand to impact every industry, from finance to insurance, human resources to healthcare and beyond, by automating customer self-service, accelerating response times on an increasing number of tasks as well as providing greater accuracy, enhanced routing and intelligent context gathering.\n\nLLMs and governance\n-------------------\n\nOrganizations need a solid foundation in governance practices to harness the potential of AI models to revolutionize the way they do business. This means providing access to AI tools and technology that is trustworthy, transparent, responsible and secure. [AI governance and traceability](https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics) are also fundamental aspects of the solutions IBM brings to its customers, so that activities that involve AI are managed and monitored to allow for tracing origins, data and models in a way that is always auditable and accountable.\n\n[Ebook How to choose the right foundation model Learn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.

The underlying transformer is a set of [neural networks](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/neural-network/) that consist of an encoder and a decoder with self-attention capabilities. The encoder and decoder extract meanings from a sequence of text and understand the relationships between words and phrases in it.\n\nTransformer LLMs are capable of unsupervised training, although a more precise explanation is that transformers perform self-learning. It is through this process that transformers learn to understand basic grammar, languages, and knowledge.\n\nUnlike earlier recurrent neural networks (RNN) that sequentially process inputs, transformers process entire sequences in parallel. This allows the data scientists to use GPUs for training transformer-based LLMs, significantly reducing the training time.\n\nTransformer neural network architecture allows the use of very large models, often with hundreds of billions of parameters. Such large-scale models can ingest massive amounts of data, often from the internet, but also from sources such as the [Common Crawl](https://registry.opendata.aws/commoncrawl/), which comprises more than 50 billion web pages, and Wikipedia, which has approximately 57 million pages.\n\n[Read more about neural networks»](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/neural-network/)\n\n[Read more about deep learning »](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/deep-learning/)\n\nWhy are large language models important?\n----------------------------------------\n\nLarge language models are incredibly flexible. One model can perform completely different tasks such as answering questions, summarizing documents, translating languages and completing sentences. LLMs have the potential to disrupt content creation and the way people use search engines and virtual assistants.\n\nWhile not perfect, LLMs are demonstrating a remarkable ability to make predictions based on a relatively small number of prompts or inputs. LLMs can be used for [generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/) (artificial intelligence) to produce content based on input prompts in human language.\n\nLLMs are big, very big. They can consider billions of parameters and have many possible uses. Here are some examples:\n\n*   Open AI\'s GPT-3 model has 175 billion parameters. Its cousin, ChatGPT, can identify patterns from data and generate natural and readable output. While we don’t know the size of Claude 2, it can take inputs up to 100K tokens in each prompt, which means it can work over hundreds of pages of technical documentation or even an entire book.\n*   AI21 Labs’ Jurassic-1 model has 178 billion parameters and a token vocabulary of 250,000-word parts and similar conversational capabilities.\n*   Cohere’s Command model has similar capabilities and can work in more than 100 different languages.\n*   LightOn\'s Paradigm offers foundation models with claimed capabilities that exceed those of GPT-3. All these LLMs come with APIs that allow developers to create unique generative AI applications.\n\n[Read more about generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/generative-ai/)[»](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/generative-ai/)\n\n[Read more about foundation models»](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/foundation-models/)\n\nHow do large language models work?\n----------------------------------\n\nA key factor in how LLMs work is the way they represent words. Earlier forms of [machine learning](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/) used a numerical table to represent each word. But, this form of representation could not recognize relationships between words such as words with similar meanings. This limitation was overcome by using multi-dimensional vectors, commonly referred to as word embeddings, to represent words so that words with similar contextual meanings or other relationships are close to each other in the vector space.\n\nUsing word embeddings, transformers can pre-process text as numerical representations through the encoder and understand the context of words and phrases with similar meanings as well as other relationships between words such as parts of speech. It is then possible for LLMs to apply this knowledge of the language through the decoder to produce a unique output.\n\nWhat are applications of large language models?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThere are many practical applications for LLMs.\n\n### Copywriting\n\nApart from GPT-3 and ChatGPT, Claude, Llama 2, Cohere Command, and Jurassiccan write original copy. AI21 Wordspice suggests changes to original sentences to improve style and voice.\n\n### Knowledge base answering\n\nOften referred to as knowledge-intensive natural language processing (KI-NLP), the technique refers to LLMs that can answer specific questions from information help in digital archives. An example is the ability of AI21 Studio playground to answer general knowledge questions.\n\n### Text classification\n\nUsing clustering, LLMs can classify text with similar meanings or sentiments. Uses include measuring customer sentiment, determining the relationship between texts, and document search.\n\n### Code generation\n\nLLM are proficient in code generation from natural language prompts. Examples include [Amazon CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/) and Open AI\'s codex used in GitHub Copilot, which can code in Python, JavaScript, Ruby and several other programming languages. Other coding applications include creating SQL queries, writing shell commands and website design. [Learn more about AI code generation](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ai-coding/).\n\n### Text generation\n\nSimilar to code generation, text generation can complete incomplete sentences, write product documentation or, like Alexa Create, write a short children\'s story.\n\nHow are large language models trained?\n--------------------------------------\n\nTransformer-based neural networks are very large. These networks contain multiple nodes and layers. Each node in a layer has connections to all nodes in the subsequent layer, each of which has a weight and a bias. Weights and biases along with embeddings are known as model parameters. Large transformer-based neural networks can have billions and billions of parameters. The size of the model is generally determined by an empirical relationship between the model size, the number of parameters, and the size of the training data.\n\nTraining is performed using a large corpus of high-quality data. During training, the model iteratively adjusts parameter values until the model correctly predicts the next token from an the previous squence of input tokens. It does this through self-learning techniques which teach the model to adjust parameters to maximize the likelihood of the next tokens in the training examples.\n\nOnce trained, LLMs can be readily adapted to perform multiple tasks using relatively small sets of supervised data, a process known as fine tuning.\n\nThree common learning models exist:\n\n*   Zero-shot learning; Base LLMs can respond to a broad range of requests without explicit training, often through prompts, although answer accuracy varies.\n*   Few-shot learning: By providing a few relevant training examples, base model performance significantly improves in that specific area.\n*   Fine-tuning: This is an extension of few-shot learning in that data scientists train a base model to adjust its parameters with additional data relevant to the specific application.\n\nWhat is the future of LLMs?\n---------------------------\n\nThe introduction of large language models like ChatGPT, Claude 2, and Llama 2 that can answer questions and generate text points to exciting possibilities in the future. Slowly, but surely, LLMs are moving closer to human-like performance. The immediate success of these LLMs demonstrates a keen interest in robotic-type LLMs that emulate and, in some contexts, outperform the human brain. Here are some thoughts on the future of LLMs,\n\n### Increased capabilities\n\nAs impressive as they are, the current level of technology is not perfect and LLMs are not infallible. However, newer releases will have improved accuracy and enhanced capabilities as developers learn how to improve their performance while reducing bias and eliminating incorrect answers.\n\n### Audiovisual training\n\nWhile developers train most LLMs using text, some have started training models using video and audio input. This form of training should lead to faster model development and open up new possibilities in terms of using LLMs for autonomous vehicles.\n\n### Workplace transformation\n\nLLMs are a disruptive factor that will change the workplace. LLMs will likely reduce monotonous and repetitive tasks in the same way that robots did for repetitive manufacturing tasks. Possibilities include repetitive clerical tasks, customer service [chatbots](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/chatbot/), and simple automated copywriting.\n\n### Conversational AI\n\nLLMs will undoubtedly improve the performance of automated virtual assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. They will be better able to interpret user intent and respond to sophisticated commands.\n\n[Read more about conversational AI](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/conversational-ai/)\n\nHow can AWS help with LLMs?\n---------------------------\n\nAWS offers several possibilities for large language model developers.

work\n==============================================\n\nLast updated:\n\nFebruary 20, 2025\n\ncontents**\u200d**\n\n[Header H2](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#)\n\n[Header

H5](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#)\n\nHow can you tell if an LLM works well or which one is better than others?\n\nLarge Language Model (LLM) **benchmarks** are standardized tests designed to measure and compare the abilities of different language models. With new LLMs released all the time, these benchmarks let researchers and practitioners see how well each model handles different tasks, from basic language skills to complex reasoning and coding.\n\nThe main reason we use LLM benchmarks is to get a consistent, uniform way to evaluate different models. Since LLMs can be used for a variety of use cases, it’s otherwise hard to compare them fairly. Benchmarks help level the playing field by putting each model through the same set of tests.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll explore the topic of LLM benchmarks and cover:\n\n*   What LLM benchmarks are, how they work, and why we need them.\n*   20 common benchmarks that assess different LLM capabilities, with links to papers and datasets.\n*   Limitations of LLM evaluation benchmarks.\n\nLet’s dive in!\n\nTL;DR\n-----\n\n*   **LLM benchmarks**are standardized tests that assess LLM performance across various tasks. Typically, they check if the model can produce the correct known response to a given input.\n*   **Common LLM benchmarks** test models for skills like language understanding, question-answering, math problem-solving, and coding tasks. **Examples**are HellaSwag, BigBench, TruthfulQA, and Chatbot Arena.\n*   Publicly available benchmarks make it easy to **compare**the capabilities of different LLMs, often showcased on **leaderboards**.\n*   Limitations of LLM benchmarks include potential **data contamination**, where models are trained on the same data they’re later tested on, **narrow focus**, and loss of relevance over time as model capabilities surpass benchmarks.\n*   While LLM benchmarks help compare LLMs, they are not suitable for[**evaluating****LLM-based products**](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-evaluation), which require custom datasets and criteria tailored to the use case.\n\nBuild AI systems you can rely on\n\nTest fast, ship faster.

They answer questions like: can this LLM handle coding tasks well? Does it give relevant answers in a conversation? How well does it solve reasoning problems?\n\nYou can think of each LLM benchmark as a specialized “exam.” Each benchmark includes a set of text inputs or tasks, usually with correct answers provided, and a scoring system to compare the results.\n\nFor example, the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark includes multiple-choice questions on mathematics, history, computer science, law, and more.\n\n![Image 29: MMLU questions example](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6720df2b878e5e2b000f578d_6720dde820f816f97747f9c5_06_mmlu-question-example-min.png)\n\n_Example questions from the MMLU benchmark. Credit:_[_Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300)\n\nAfter you run an LLM through the benchmark, you can assess the correctness of its answers against the “ground truth” and get a quantitative score to compare and rank different LLMs.\n\nWhile MMLU tests general knowledge, there are benchmarks targeting other areas like:\n\n*   **Language skills,** including logical inference and text comprehension.\n*   **Math problem-solving**, with tasks from basic arithmetic to complex calculus.\n*   **Coding**, testing the ability to generate code and solve programming challenges.\n*   **Conversation**, assessing the quality of responses in a dialogue.\n*   **Safety**, checking if models avoid harmful responses and resist manipulation.\n*   **Domain-specific knowledge**, such as for fields like law and finance.\n\n##### **[fs-toc-omit]100+ examples of LLM benchmarks**\n\n> Want more examples of LLM benchmarks? We put together [database](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-evaluation-benchmarks-datasets)of 100+ LLM benchmarks and datasets you can use to evaluate the performance of language models.[Bookmark the list ⟶](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-evaluation-benchmarks-datasets)\n\nLLM benchmarks vary in difficulty. Early ones focused on basic tasks like classifying text or completing sentences, which worked well for evaluating smaller models like BERT. Now, with powerful models like GPT, Claude, or LLaMA, benchmarks have become more sophisticated and often include complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning.\n\nLLM benchmarks are created by research groups, universities, tech companies, and open-source communities. Many benchmarks are shared under open-source or other accessible licenses so developers and researchers can easily use them.\n\n![Image 30: LLM evaluation benchmarks](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6772b4807bf6af1d802384b3_6772b4710992b17d04510e47_cheerful-robot-students-take-exam%2520(1)%2520(1).jpeg)\n\nWhy we need LLM benchmarks\n--------------------------\n\n**Evaluation standardization and transparency.** LLM benchmarks provide consistent, reproducible ways to assess and rank how well different LLMs handle specific tasks. They allow for an "apples-to-apples" comparison—like grading all students in a class on the same tests.\n\nWhenever a new LLM is released, benchmarks help communicate how it stacks up against others, giving a snapshot of its overall abilities. With shared evaluation standards, others can also independently verify these results using the same tests and metrics.\n\n**Progress tracking and fine-tuning.**LLM benchmarks also serve as progress markers. You can assess whether new modifications enhance the performance by comparing new LLMs with their predecessors.\n\nWe can already see a history where certain benchmarks became outdated as models consistently surpassed them, pushing researchers to develop more challenging benchmarks to keep up with advanced LLM capabilities.\n\nYou can also use benchmarks to identify the model’s weak spots. For instance, a safety benchmark can show how well a given LLM handles novel threats. This, in turn, guides the fine-tuning process and helps LLM researchers advance the field.\n\n**Model selection.** For practitioners, benchmarks also provide a useful reference when deciding which model to use in specific applications.\n\nSay, you’re building a customer support chatbot powered by an LLM. You’d need a model with strong conversational skills–one that can engage in dialogue, maintain context, and provide helpful responses. Which commercial or open-source LLMs should you consider using? By looking at the performance of different models on relevant benchmarks, you can narrow down your shortlist to ones that do well on standard tests.\n\n![Image 31: LLM evaluation benchmarks](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6772b3d94d2ae2e17f1407fd_6772b3c640850ea32345d15a_cheerful-robot-on-a-pedestal-with-a-gold-medal%2520(1)%2520(1).jpeg)\n\nHow LLM benchmarks work\n-----------------------\n\nLLM benchmarks evaluate LLMs on fixed tests. But how exactly do they function?\n\nIn short, benchmarks expose models to a variety of test inputs and measure their performance using standardized metrics for easy comparison and ranking.\n\nLet’s explore the process step by step!\n\n**1. Dataset input and testing**\n\nA benchmark includes tasks for a model to complete, like solving math problems, writing code, answering questions, or translating text. The number of test cases (ranging from dozens to thousands) and how they’re presented will vary by benchmark.\n\nOften, it’s a **dataset of text inputs:**the LLM must process each input and produce a specific response, like completing a sentence, selecting the correct option from multiple choices, or generating a free-form text. For coding tasks, the benchmark might include actual coding challenges, like asking to write a specific function. Some benchmarks also provide prompt templates to instruct the LLM on processing the inputs.\n\nMost benchmarks come with a set of “**ground truth**” answers to compare against, though alternative evaluation methods exist, like Chatbot Arena, which uses crowdsourced human labels. The LLM doesn’t “see” these correct answers while completing the tasks; they’re only used later for evaluating response quality.\n\n**2. Performance evaluation and scoring**\n\nOnce the model completes the benchmark tasks, you can measure its quality! Each benchmark includes a scoring mechanism to quantify how well an LLM performs, with different [evaluation methods](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-evaluation-metrics) suited to different task types. Here are some examples:\n\n*   **Classification Metrics**like [accuracy](https://www.evidentlyai.com/classification-metrics/accuracy-precision-recall#what-is-accuracy). These metrics are ideal for tasks with a single correct answer. For instance, the MMLU benchmark uses multiple-choice questions, allowing us to simply calculate the percentage of correct responses across the dataset.\n\n*   **Overlap-based metrics**like BLEU and ROUGE**.** They are used for tasks like translation or free-form responses, where various phrasing options are valid, and an exact match is rare. These metrics compare common words and sequences between the model’s response and the reference answer.\n*   **Functional code quality.** Some coding benchmarks, like HumanEval, use unique metrics such as pass@k, which reflects how many generated code samples pass unit tests for given problems.\n*   **Fine-tuned evaluator models.**The TruthfulQA benchmark uses a fine-tuned evaluator called "GPT-Judge" (based on GPT-3) to assess the truthfulness of answers by classifying them as true or false.\n*   [**LLM-as-a-judge**](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge). MT-bench introduced LLM-based evaluation to approximate human preferences. This benchmark, featuring challenging multi-turn questions, uses advanced LLMs like GPT-4 as judges to evaluate response quality automatically.\n\n**3. LLM ranking and LLM leaderboards**\n\nAs you run multiple LLMs through the benchmark, you can rank them based on achieved scores. One way to visualize how different models compare is a **leaderboard:**a ranking system that shows how different models perform on a specific benchmark or set of benchmarks.\n\nMany benchmarks come with their own leaderboards, often published with the original research paper that introduced the benchmark. These leaderboards provide a snapshot of model performance when first tested on available models.\n\nIn addition, there are public, cross-benchmark leaderboards that aggregate scores from multiple benchmarks and are regularly updated as new models are released. For example, Hugging Face hosts an open LLM leaderboard that ranks various open-source models based on popular benchmarks (stay tuned—we’ll cover these in the next chapter!).\n\n> **Examples of LLM leaderboards:**[MMLU leaderboard](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/multi-task-language-understanding-on-mmlu), [Chatbot Arena leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard), [Hugging Face collection of LLM leaderboards](https://huggingface.co/collections/open-llm-leaderboard/the-big-benchmarks-collection-64faca6335a7fc7d4ffe974a)\n\n![Image 32: Open LLM leaderboard example](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6720df2b878e5e2b000f5793_6720deae18d16faf3156f699_03_llm_leaderboard_example.png)\n\n_Example leaderboard based on the common LLM benchmarks.

LLM benchmarks vary depending on the task—e.g., text classification, machine translation, question answering, reasoning, etc. We will cover some of the commonly used ones. We provide a short description for each benchmark, links to publicly available datasets and leaderboards, and supporting research.\n\n### Reasoning and language understanding benchmarks\n\n#### **[fs-toc-omit]**AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)\n\n**Assets:**[ARC dataset (HuggingFace)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/ai2_arc), [ARC leaderboard](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/arc/submissions/public)\n\n**Research:**[Think you have Solved Question Answering?

Public test data can unintentionally leak into datasets used to train LLMs, compromising evaluation integrity. If a model has seen specific answers during training, it may "know" them rather than demonstrate a true ability to solve that task. One approach to prevent this is to keep some benchmark data private and regularly create new or expand existing benchmark datasets.\n\n**Benchmarks can quickly become outdated.** Once a model achieves the highest possible score on a particular benchmark, that benchmark loses its effectiveness as a measure of progress. This necessitates the creation of more difficult and nuanced tasks to keep pushing the boundaries of LLM development. Many of the existing benchmarks already lost their relevance as modern LLMs progress in their abilities.\n\n**Benchmarks may not reflect real-world performance.** Many benchmarks are built around specific, well-defined tasks that may not fully capture the complexity and variety of scenarios encountered in real-world applications. As a result, a model that excels in benchmarks may still fail on applied tasks, even those that seem straightforward.\n\n**Benchmarks aren’t enough for evaluating LLM apps.**Generic LLM benchmarks are useful for testing models but don’t work for LLM-powered applications. In real apps like chatbots or virtual assistants, it’s not just the model—you also have prompts, external knowledge databases, and business logic to consider. To test these systems effectively, you’ll need “your own” benchmarks: those that include real, application-specific inputs and standards for correct behavior.\n\nCreate a benchmark for your AI system\n-------------------------------------\n\nLLM benchmarks are great for comparing models, but when building an AI product, you need custom [test datasets](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-test-dataset-synthetic-data) that reflect your use case. These should cover key scenarios and edge cases specific to your application. You\'ll also need task-specific evaluations, like [LLM judges](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge) tuned to your custom criteria and preferences.\n\nThat’s why we built [Evidently](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge).

These benchmarks consist of sample data, a set of questions or tasks to test LLMs on specific skills, metrics for evaluating performance and a scoring mechanism.\n\nModels are benchmarked based on their capabilities, such as coding, common sense and reasoning. Other capabilities encompass [natural language processing](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing), including machine translation, question answering and [text summarization](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/text-summarization).\n\nLLM benchmarks play a crucial role in developing and enhancing models. Benchmarks showcase the progress of an LLM as it learns, with quantitative measures that highlight where the model excels and its areas for improvement.\n\nThis in turn guides the [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning) process, which helps LLM researchers and developers advance the field. LLM benchmarks also provide an objective comparison of different models, helping inform software developers and organizations as they choose which models better suit their needs.\n\n## How LLM benchmarks work\n\nLLM benchmarks operate in a straightforward manner. They supply a task that an LLM must accomplish, evaluate model performance according to a certain metric and produce a score based on that metric. Here’s how each step works in detail:\n\n### Setting up\n\nLLM benchmarks already have sample data prepared—coding challenges, large documents, math problems, real-world conversations, science questions. A range of tasks are also at the ready, including commonsense reasoning, problem-solving, question answering, summary generation and translation. These are all given to the model at the outset of testing.\n\n### Testing\n\nWhen running the benchmark, it’s introduced to a model in one of three approaches:\n\n- [Few-shot](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/few-shot-learning): Before prompting an LLM to perform a task, it’s supplied with a small number of examples showing how to fulfill that task. This demonstrates a model’s ability to learn given scarce data.\n- [Zero-shot](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/zero-shot-learning): An LLM is prompted to complete a task without having seen any examples beforehand. This unveils a model’s ability to comprehend new concepts and adapt to novel scenarios.\n- Fine-tuned: A model is trained on a dataset akin to what the benchmark uses. The goal is to boost the LLM’s command of the task associated with the benchmark and optimize its performance in that specific task.\n\n### Scoring\n\nOnce tests are done, an LLM benchmark computes how close a model’s output resembles the expected solution or standard answer, then generates a score between 0 and 100.\n\n![3D design of balls rolling on a track](/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/pm/ul/g/5a/6e/trailv2_1200x1200.component.think-ad-xl.ts=1746554193743.jpeg/content/experience-fragments/adobe-cms/us/en/site-v2/think-hub/article/_8_column_general_ad/blueprint---think-ad---xf---do-not-modify/artificialintelligence-article-newsletter/_jcr_content/root/think_ad_copy/image)\n\n### The latest AI News + Insights\n\nDiscover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.\n\n[Subscribe today](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=news-urx-52954)\n\n## Key metrics for benchmarking LLMs\n\nBenchmarks apply different metrics to evaluate the performance of LLMs. Here are some common ones:\n\n- **Accuracy or precision** calculates the percentage of correct predictions.\n- **Recall**, also called the sensitivity rate, quantifies the number of true positives—the actual correct predictions.\n- The **F1 score** blends both accuracy and recall into one metric. It considers the two measures to be of equal weight to balance out any false positives or false negatives. F1 scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 signifying excellent recall and precision.\n- **Exact match** is the proportion of predictions an LLM matches exactly and is a valuable criteria for translation and question answering.\n- **Perplexity** measures how good a model is at prediction. The lower an LLM’s perplexity score, the better it is at comprehending a task.\n- **Bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU)** evaluates machine translation by computing the matching n-grams (a sequence of n-adjacent text symbols) between an LLM’s predicted translation and a human-produced translation.\n- **Recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE)** evaluates text summarization and has several types. ROUGE-N, for instance, does similar calculations as BLEU for summaries, while ROUGE-L computes the longest common subsequence between the predicted summary and the human-produced summary.\n\nOne or more of these quantitative metrics are usually combined for a more comprehensive and robust assessment.\n\nMeanwhile, human evaluation involves qualitative metrics such as coherence, relevance and semantic meaning. Human assessors examining and scoring an LLM can make for a more nuanced assessment, but it can be labor intensive, subjective and time consuming. Therefore, a balance of both quantitative and qualitative metrics is needed.\n\nAI Academy\n\n### Why foundation models are a paradigm shift for AI\n\nLearn about a new class of flexible, reusable AI models that can unlock new revenue, reduce costs and increase productivity, then use our guidebook to dive deeper.\n\n[Go to episode](https://www.ibm.com/think/videos/ai-academy/foundation-models-paradigm-shift)\n\n## Limitations of LLM benchmarks\n\nWhile benchmarks are solid indicators of LLM performance, they can’t predict how well a model will operate in the real world. Here are a few constraints of LLM benchmarks:\n\nBounded scoring\n\n\nOnce a model reaches the highest possible score for a certain benchmark, that benchmark will need to be updated with more difficult tasks to make it a useful measure.\n\nBroad dataset\n\n\nSince LLM benchmarks use sample data derived mostly from a broad range of subjects and a wide array of tasks, they may not be a fitting metric for edge scenarios, specialized areas or specific use cases.\n\nFinite assessments\n\n\nLLM benchmarks can only test a model’s current skills. But as LLMs advance and novel capabilities emerge, new benchmarks will have to be created.\n\nOverfitting\n\n\nIf an LLM is trained on the same dataset as the benchmark, it could lead to [overfitting](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/overfitting), wherein the model might perform well on the test data but not on real-world data. This results in a score that doesn’t reflect an LLM’s actual abilities.\n\n## What are LLM leaderboards?\n\nLLM leaderboards publish a ranking of LLMs based on a variety of benchmarks. Leaderboards provide a way to keep track of the myriad LLMs and compare their performance. LLM leaderboards are especially beneficial in making decisions on which models to use.\n\nEach benchmark typically has its own leaderboard, but independent LLM leaderboards also exist. For instance, Hugging Face has a collection of leaderboards, one of which is an open LLM leaderboard that ranks multiple open-source models based on the ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA and Winogrande benchmarks.\n\n## Common LLM benchmarks\n\nResearchers classify LLM benchmarks according to these two aspects:1\n\n- **Assessment criteria:**\xa0LLM evaluation metrics can either be ground truth or human preferences.\xa0**Ground truth**\xa0refers to information assumed to be true, while\xa0**human preferences**\xa0are choices reflecting real-world usage.\n- **Source of questions:**\xa0Prompts can come from either static or live sources. **Static** prompts contain predefined questions, while **live** prompts are questions made in an interactive environment.\n\nBenchmarks can fall into one or more of these categories. Here’s how some popular benchmarks work:\n\n### AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)\n\nARC measures an LLM’s question answering and reasoning abilities through a series of more than 7,000 grade-school natural science questions. These questions are divided into an easy set and a challenge set. Scoring is simple, with a model getting one point for each correct answer and 1/N points if it provides multiple answers and one of those is correct.2\n\n### Chatbot Arena\n\nChatbot Arena is an open benchmark platform that pits two anonymous chatbots against each other. Users have random real-world conversations with both chatbots in an “arena,” then cast votes on which one they prefer, after which the models’ identities are revealed. This crowdsourced pairwise comparison data is fed into statistical methods that estimate scores and create approximate rankings for various LLMs. Sampling algorithms are also used to pair models.1\n\n### Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K)\n\nGSM8K tests an LLM’s mathematical reasoning skills. It has a corpus of 8,500 grade-school math word problems. Solutions are collected in the form of natural language instead of mathematical expressions. AI verifiers are trained to evaluate model solutions.3\n\n### HellaSwag\n\nHellaSwag is an acronym for “Harder Endings, Longer contexts and Low-shot Activities for Situations With Adversarial Generations.” This benchmark is centered around commonsense reasoning and natural language inference. Models are tasked with completing sentences by choosing from a number of possible endings. These endings include wrong answers created through adversarial filtering, an algorithm that generates realistic yet deceptively incorrect answers. HellaSwag evaluates accuracy for both few-shot and zero-shot categories.4\n\n### HumanEval\n\nHumanEval assesses an LLM’s performance in terms of [code generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/code-generator), specifically functional correctness. Models are given programming problems to solve and are evaluated based on passing the corresponding unit tests. This is similar to human software developers who test if their code is correct based on passing particular unit tests. The HumanEval benchmark uses its own evaluation metric called pass@k, which is the probability that at least one of the k-generated code solutions for a coding problem passes that problem’s unit tests.5\n\n### Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)\n\nMMLU is a benchmark assessing the breadth of an LLM’s knowledge, the depth of its [natural language understanding](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/nlp-vs-nlu-vs-nlg) and its ability to solve problems based on gained knowledge. MMLU’s dataset encompasses more than 15,000 multiple-choice general knowledge questions across 57 subjects. Evaluation occurs solely in few-shot and zero-shot settings. The MMLU benchmark scores a model’s accuracy in each subject then averages those numbers for a final score.6\n\n### Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP)\n\nMBPP, also known as Mostly Basic Python Problems, is another code generation benchmark. It has a corpus of more than 900 coding tasks. Akin to HumanEval, it assesses functional correctness based on passing a set of test cases. Evaluation happens in few-shot and fine-tuned settings. MBPP uses two metrics: the percentage of problems that are solved by any sample from the model and the percentage of samples solving their respective tasks.7\n\n### MT-Bench\n\nThe researchers behind Chatbot Arena also created MT-Bench, which is designed to test how well an LLM can engage in dialogue and follow instructions. Its dataset consists of open-ended multi-turn questions, with 10 questions each in these eight areas: coding, extraction, knowledge I (STEM), knowledge II (humanities and social sciences), math, reasoning, roleplay and writing. MT-Bench uses the GPT-4 LLM to evaluate the responses of other LLMs.8\n\n### SWE-bench\n\nLike HumanEval, SWE-bench tests an LLM’s [code generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-code-generation) skills, with a focus on issue resolution. Models are tasked with fixing a bug or addressing a feature request in a specific code base. The benchmark’s assessment metric is the percentage of resolved task instances.9\n\n### TruthfulQA\n\nLarge language models have a tendency to [hallucinate](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations), resulting in inaccurate outputs. The TruthfulQA benchmark aims to tackle this by measuring an LLM’s ability to generate truthful answers to questions. Its dataset contains more than 800 questions spanning 38 subjects. TruthfulQA combines human evaluation with the GPT-3 LLM fine-tuned on the BLEU and ROUGE metrics to predict human assessments of informativeness and truthfulness.10\n\n### Winogrande\n\nWinogrande evaluates an LLM’s commonsense reasoning capabilities. It builds upon the original Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) benchmark, with a huge dataset of 44,000 crowdsourced problems that also uses adversarial filtering.

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ['## Landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) constitute the backbone of contemporary artificial intelligence applications in natural language processing, enabling advances in human-like understanding, content generation, multimodal reasoning, and autonomous agent systems. This section provides an exhaustive review of the LLM landscape as of mid-2024, addressing the leading providers, technical and architectural innovations, comparative capabilities, and emergent trends shaping the next epoch of language-driven AI technologies.\n\n---\n\n### Defining LLMs and Architectural Typology\n\nLLMs are expansive deep neural networks, predominantly built on the Transformer architecture, that are trained on heterogeneous datasets comprising web texts, books, source code, scientific literature, and domain-specific resources. Their architectural taxonomy is multifaceted, including:\n\n- **Encoder-Decoder Models** (e.g., T5, BART): Separate modules for encoding input and decoding output sequences, enabling flexible sequence-to-sequence tasks.\n- **Causal Decoder/Autoregressive Models** (e.g., GPT series): Unidirectional attention mechanisms that predict each token based on preceding context, excelling at generative tasks.\n- **Prefix Decoders** (e.g., GLM series): Combine bidirectional attention for conditioning on prompts with unidirectional generation, improving contextual adaptation.\n- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architectures** (e.g., DeepSeek V3, Llama 4): Distribute computation across multiple subnetworks (“experts”), selectively activating a subset per token to enhance efficiency at scale.\n\nModern LLMs display parameter scales from a few million to several hundred billion, with the most advanced (e.g., DeepSeek V3, Llama 4) pushing toward trillion-parameter territory using sparse and expert-driven computation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Major Providers and Model Families\n\n#### OpenAI\n\nOpenAI’s GPT lineage (GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o) have defined industry benchmarks for reasoning, code generation, and multimodality. The recent “o” series (e.g., GPT-4o) introduces native multimodal abilities—handling text, images, audio, and video—and significantly faster, more cost-efficient inference. Specialized “reasoning” models like o1 and o3 focus on chain-of-thought problem-solving, achieving high marks on academic and coding benchmarks. OpenAI’s model context windows now span up to 1 million tokens, addressing use cases in document analysis and legal research.\n\n#### Google DeepMind\n\nGoogle’s LLM progression leads from PaLM and PaLM-2 to the current Gemini portfolio (Ultra, Pro, Flash, and open-source Gemma variants). Gemini models are engineered as natively multimodal and boast the highest performance on multilingual and multiformat (text, image, audio, video) tasks. Flash variants enable lightning-fast output and vast context accommodation via architectural optimizations like sliding window attention. Gemma, derived from Gemini, brings high-performance open-source models with parameter sizes optimized for research and edge deployment.\n\n#### Meta AI\n\nMeta’s LLaMA series (Llama 2, 3, and 4), famed for their open weights, underpin much of contemporary academic and open-source LLM research. Llama 4, the latest flagship, integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers and a pioneering context window of up to 10 million tokens. Meta’s innovations in Grouped-Query Attention, task specialization (e.g., Code Llama for programming), and multimodality with vision capabilities make the Llama family cornerstone assets for enterprise and research deployment.\n\n#### Anthropic\n\nAnthropic’s Claude models (Claude 3—Haiku, Sonnet, Opus—and the emerging Claude 4 series) prioritize AI safety, transparency, and alignment, leveraging stepwise reasoning (“chain-of-thought”) and Constitutional AI to achieve superior harmlessness and reliability. Claude Opus offers 200,000 token context and robust multimodal perception (chart, graph, and image analysis), making it a leader in long-context and compliance-sensitive applications.\n\n#### Open-Source and Specialist Entrants\n\nA vibrant open-source ecosystem supplements the giants:\n- **Mistral/Mixtral:** Mixture-of-Experts models excelling at code and summarization, optimized for small-footprint, high-efficiency use.\n- **DeepSeek:** MoE-driven architectures like DeepSeek V3 scale to 671B+ parameters with competitive reasoning performance.\n- **Gemma, SmolLM, Qwen:** Compact, resource-efficient models designed for lightweight hardware or specialized use cases (on-device, mobile).\n- **Domain-specific**: Models like Code Llama (programming), BiomedLM (biomedical), and StarCoder (software development) reflect increasing specialization.\n\n---\n\n### Architectural and Technical Innovations\n\n#### Attention and Memory Mechanisms\n\nEfficient handling of long input sequences and contextual memory is critical:\n- **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA):** Reduces compute requirements, as seen in Llama 3/4 and Gemma 3.\n- **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA):** DeepSeek’s innovation to compress key-value cache, enhancing scalability.\n- **Sliding Window/FlashAttention:** Techniques (deployed in Gemma, Flash, Llama 4) that improve throughput for extended context windows, enabling efficient million-token processing.\n\n#### Normalization, Activation, and Position Encoding\n\n- **RMSNorm and QK-Norm:** Replace LayerNorm for improved computational efficiency and stability.\n- **SwiGLU/GeGLU activations:** Deliver higher accuracy in transformer feed-forward networks.\n- **Rotary/No Position Embeddings (RoPE/NoPE):** Enhance the models’ handling of token order, generalizing better to sequences of varying lengths.\n\n#### Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and Sparse Models\n\nState-of-the-art models increasingly incorporate MoE or sparse layers, activating only subsets of parameters per token, thus reconciling enormous parameter scales with manageable inference costs. Sparse specialization facilitates task-specific “experts,” a direction anticipated to define next-generation scaling and efficiency.\n\n#### Training Paradigms and Fine-Tuning Approaches\n\n- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** Models are explicitly trained for stepwise logical and mathematical inference, markedly improving accuracy on complex, multi-step problems.\n- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):** Essential for alignment with human preferences, enhancing model helpfulness and reducing harmful outputs.\n- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):** Techniques such as adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning enable rapid domain adaptation without full retraining.\n- **Quantization and Compression:** 8-bit and 4-bit variants make large models feasible for deployment on limited hardware.\n\n---\n\n### Comparative Analysis: Capabilities and Performance Benchmarks\n\n#### Intelligence, Reasoning, and Task Proficiency\n\nTop-tier models distinguish themselves across various public benchmarks:\n- **OpenAI o1-preview:** Achieves 83% on U.S. high-school math competitions, matching PhD-level science proficiency.\n- **Gemini Ultra:** Edges out GPT-4 on multilingual and reasoning evaluations.\n- **Claude Opus:** Leading performer in long-document and multimodal comprehension.\n- **Meta Llama 4 Scout:** Offers a record 10-million-token context window for document-centric tasks.\n\nThe choice of model is increasingly context-driven; for example, enterprise applications may favor Claude or Cohere (safety, compliance), while local/private deployments gravitate towards Llama or Gemma for openness and control.\n\n#### Multimodality and Deployment Modalities\n\nThe prevailing trend is toward **native multimodality**. Models such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude 4 seamlessly process and generate text, images, audio, and video. Deployment options have diversified:\n- **Cloud APIs:** For scalable, managed access (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic).\n- **On-Premises/Edge:** On-device models for privacy, latency, and offline capability (Gemma 3, SmolLM, Phi-3).\n- **Open Weights:** Meta and Google’s open models permit customization and research unfettered by proprietary constraints.\n\n#### Speed, Cost, and Scalability\n\nEfficiency benchmarks (tokens/sec), cost per million tokens, and context size drive model selection for enterprise:\n- **High-speed output:** Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite and GPT-OSS-20B excel in throughput.\n- **Cost-effectiveness:** Google’s Gemma 3n E4B and Meta Llama rank among the most affordable for large-scale deployments.\n- **Resource-Constrained Deployment:** Models like SmolLM3 and Gemma 3n enable LLM adoption on mobile devices.\n\n#### Safety, Bias, and Ethical Optimization\n\nThe risk of hallucination, bias, and toxic output is an ever-present research focus. Techniques like red-teaming, advanced moderation, constitutional AI (Anthropic), and dataset filtering are foundational. Despite progress, open issues such as persistence of social bias and the difficulty of fully eliminating hallucinations in unfamiliar or long-context domains remain under active investigation.\n\n---\n\n### Recent Trends and Research Directions\n\n#### Beyond Scaling: Specialization, Efficiency, and Agents\n\nThe LLM field is pivoting from naive scaling toward efficiency gains (MoE, quantization), real-time reasoning, and specialized agents:\n- **Compound AI:** LLMs are embedded in structured pipelines (retrieval-augmented generation, tool-use agents, decision-support).\n- **Open-Source Surge:** Open-weight leaders (Llama, Gemma, DeepSeek, Mistral) are narrowing the performance gap with proprietary models.\n- **Benchmark Diversity:** Benchmarking now addresses intelligence, speed, cost, hallucination, bias, and application fitness, rather than raw perplexity or size alone.\n\n#### Multimodal, Internet-Connected, and On-Device Models\n\nEmergent models ingest and synthesize media beyond text, are capable of real-time internet retrieval, and are optimized for device-level operation—all major shifts from even 2022’s paradigms. Developers increasingly tailor model selection to context: open-source for privacy/control, proprietary models for highest accuracy or multimodality.\n\n#### Regulatory, Ethical, and Societal Impact\n\nWith absolute model scale and potential growing, regulatory compliance, ethical safeguards, and transparent auditing have become operational imperatives. Models are now evaluated not only by technical prowess, but also by their ability to minimize bias, toxicity, privacy invasion, and misinformation.\n\n---\n\n### Exemplary Use Cases and Industry Applications\n\nLLMs are now deployed across diverse sectors:\n- **Customer Support and Conversational AI:** Automating high-volume, context-aware dialogue.\n- **Content Creation:** Generating news, reports, creative writing, marketing copy, and multimedia.\n- **Coding Assistance:** OpenAI’s Codex, Meta’s Code Llama, and DeepSeek for software development and debugging.\n- **Scientific Discovery:** Literature mining, hypothesis generation, and data synthesis in biomedical research.\n- **Legal and Document Analysis:** Large-context models (e.g., Llama 4 Scout) for summarization, analysis, and compliance tracking.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways from the 2023–2024 LLM Landscape\n\nThe rapidly evolving LLM ecosystem is pushing boundaries in scale, multimodality, efficiency, specialization, and safety. The distinction between proprietary and open-source models has narrowed, with community-driven models increasingly rivaling enterprise solutions. Continuous advancements in attention mechanisms, multimodal integration, and alignment methods ensure that the LLM field remains dynamic and central to future AI-powered automation, knowledge work, and research innovation. The nuanced selection and deployment of LLMs—factoring intelligence, cost, safety, modality, and regulatory context—is now an essential strategic consideration for organizations and developers.'], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='comparison of leading large language models 2024 OpenAI Google Meta Anthropic'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://medium.com/@ajay.malik/comparing-top-large-language-models-llms-in-2024-openai-google-meta-deepseek-and-more-4a8371af688d', title='Comparing Top Large Language Models (LLMs) in 2024', raw_content='Sign up\n\n[Sign in](/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40ajay.malik%2Fcomparing-top-large-language-models-llms-in-2024-openai-google-meta-deepseek-and-more-4a8371af688d&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\n\nSign up\n\n[Sign in](/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40ajay.malik%2Fcomparing-top-large-language-models-llms-in-2024-openai-google-meta-deepseek-and-more-4a8371af688d&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png)\n![]()\n\n# Comparing Top Large Language Models (LLMs) in 2024: OpenAI, Google, Meta, DeepSeek, and More\n\n![Ajay Malik](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*qvkM_WTdLAlP1lTSBvFiKw@2x.jpeg)\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nShare\n\nArtificial intelligence is advancing rapidly, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are at the forefront of this revolution.

With the rapid advancement of AI technology, LLMs have revolutionized the way we interact with text, enabling us to communicate, analyze, and generate content with unprecedented sophistication. In this in-depth analysis, we delve into the world of leading LLMs, exploring their capabilities, applications, and performance. Our comparative analysis not only includes renowned OpenAI models but also sheds light on other noteworthy contenders such as Anthropic, Cohere, Google, and more.\n\nJoin us as we unravel the fascinating landscape of LLMs, uncover their unique features, and ultimately help you make informed decisions by harnessing the power of natural language processing systems.\n\n### Meet the Leading Large Language Models\n\nWe invite you to meet the leading large language models that are shaping the landscape of artificial intelligence. These remarkable models possess extraordinary capabilities in comprehending and generating text, setting new standards in natural language processing.\n\n![Image 7](https://framerusercontent.com/images/MUA9Z3CqDgFsGtwSVdxRAqMdpg.png)\nA more detailed version of this leaderboard can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZUtaPiK2VDyILuRnHaQtrDzeeqr7FvrZ_iEaADyXEjs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nNow, let\'s examine each of these models in more detail.\n\n### OpenAI\n\n**OpenAI**, an artificial intelligence research laboratory, has carved a remarkable path in advancing the boundaries of human-like language processing.\n\n![Image 8](https://framerusercontent.com/images/RaZBUOLBxUoVxlKvbvzMs7pCwuY.png)\nOpenAI released numerous influential language models, including the entire GPT family such as **GPT-3** and **GPT-4**, which power their ChatGPT product, that have captured the imagination of developers, researchers, and enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nWe encourage you to explore [examples and tutorials](https://docs.mindsdb.com/use-cases/overview) that present the usage of OpenAI models within MindsDB.\n\n[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) models have garnered attention for their impressive features and state-of-the-art performance. These models possess remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. They excel at a wide range of language-related tasks, including text completion, translation, question-answering, and more.\n\nThe GPT family of models, including **GPT-4** and **GPT-3.5 Turbo**, has been trained on internet data, codes, instructions, and human feedback, with over a hundred billion parameters, which ensures the quality of the models.\n\nThe **GPT-4o** model family is designed for seamless human-computer interaction. With its omnidirectional capabilities stemming from native multimodality, GPT-4o can process a variety of inputs including text, audio, image, and video, and generate corresponding outputs. It boasts remarkable speed, responding to audio inputs in milliseconds. Notably, GPT-4o matches GPT-4 Turbo\'s performance in English text and code, excelling further in non-English languages, all while being significantly faster and more cost-effective.\n\nOpenAI\'s **o1 model family**, introduced in September 2024, represents a major leap in AI reasoning, particularly in complex problem-solving across mathematics, coding, and science. The family includes **o1-preview**, which performs at PhD-level proficiency in subjects like physics and chemistry, scoring 83% on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination, and **o1-mini**, a faster, more cost-effective version optimized for coding and STEM tasks at 80% lower cost. These models leverage reinforcement learning to improve step-by-step reasoning and error correction, making them significantly more capable than previous AI systems. OpenAI\'s o1 models mark a shift toward AI that "thinks" before responding, enabling more advanced, human-like problem-solving.\n\nOpenAI provides different usage options through their API, including [fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning), where users can adapt the models to specific tasks or domains by providing custom training data. Additionally, options like _temperature_ and _max\\_tokens_ control the output style and length of the generated text, allowing users to customize the behavior of the models according to their specific needs.\n\nOpenAI has pioneered the development of [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences) (RLHF), a technique that shapes the behavior of their models in chat contexts.

Output tokens commonly have a significantly lower limit (varied by model).\n\nOutput Speed: Tokens per second received while the model is generating tokens (ie. after first chunk has been received from the API for models which support streaming).\n\nLatency (Time to First Token): Time to first token received, in seconds, after API request sent. For reasoning models which share reasoning tokens, this will be the first reasoning token. For models which do not support streaming, this represents time to receive the completion.\n\nPrice: Price per token, represented as USD per million Tokens. Price is a blend of Input & Output token prices (3:1 ratio).\n\nOutput Price: Price per token generated by the model (received from the API), represented as USD per million Tokens.\n\nInput Price: Price per token included in the request/message sent to the API, represented as USD per million Tokens.\n\nTime period: Metrics are 'live' and are based on the past 72 hours of measurements, measurements are taken 8 times a day for single requests and 2 times per day for parallel requests.\n\nModels compared: OpenAI: GPT 4o Audio, GPT 4o Realtime, GPT 4o Speech Pipeline, GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo (0125), GPT-3.5 Turbo (0301), GPT-3.5 Turbo (0613), GPT-3.5 Turbo (1106), GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo (0125), GPT-4 Turbo (1106), GPT-4 Vision, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, GPT-4.1 nano, GPT-4.5 (Preview), GPT-4o (April 2025), GPT-4o (Aug '24), GPT-4o (ChatGPT), GPT-4o (March 2025), GPT-4o (May '24), GPT-4o (Nov '24), GPT-4o Realtime (Dec '24), GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o mini Realtime (Dec '24), gpt-oss-120B (high), gpt-oss-20B (high), o1, o1-mini, o1-preview, o1-pro, o3, o3-mini, o3-mini (high), o3-pro, and o4-mini (high), Meta: Code Llama 70B, Llama 2 Chat 13B, Llama 2 Chat 70B, Llama 2 Chat 7B, Llama 3 70B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 405B, Llama 3.1 70B, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.2 11B (Vision), Llama 3.2 1B, Llama 3.2 3B, Llama 3.2 90B (Vision), Llama 3.3 70B, Llama 4 Behemoth, Llama 4 Maverick, Llama 4 Scout, and Llama 65B, Google: Gemini 1.0 Pro, Gemini 1.0 Ultra, Gemini 1.5 Flash (May), Gemini 1.5 Flash (Sep), Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B, Gemini 1.5 Pro (May), Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sep), Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.0 Flash (exp), Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking exp.

Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 excel in NLP tasks through advanced architectures, including encoder-decoder, causal decoder, and prefix decoder. This article delves into their configurations, activation functions, and training stability for optimal performance.\n\n![Akshit Mehra](/blog/content/images/size/w100/2023/09/pic_akshit.webp)\n\n#### [Akshit Mehra](/blog/author/akshit/)\n\n![silicon board shaped as human brain](/blog/content/images/size/w2000/2023/05/08kqxtF0wOR294ukfFuRLXEWE052-hl93pga.png)\n\n\nExploring Architectures and Configurations for Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nLanguage models have become increasingly successful in recent years, especially [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.labellerr.com/llm?ref=labellerr.com) like GPT-4.\n\nThese models have shown remarkable abilities in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation, language translation, question-answering, and more.\n\nTheir success can be attributed to their ability to learn from large amounts of text data and sophisticated architecture and training methods.\n\nMoreover, LLMs have opened up new possibilities for various applications in artificial intelligence (AI) and NLP. For example, they have been used to improve chatbots, automated content generation, and voice assistants.\n\nIn this blog, we discuss the [architecture design of Language Models (LLMs)](https://www.labellerr.com/llm?ref=labellerr.com), including the mainstream architecture, pre-training objective, and detailed configuration.\n\nThe Transformer architecture is widely used for LLMs due to its parallelizability and capacity, enabling the scaling of language models to billions or even trillions of parameters.\n\nExisting LLMs can be broadly classified into three types: encoder-decoder, causal decoder, and prefix decoder.\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n\n## General Architecture\n\nAs discussed above, the existing LLMs can be broadly classified into 3 types: encoder-decoder, causal decoder, and prefix decoder.\n\n![Examining the attention patterns in three prominent architectures reveals distinct differences.

The attention between prefix tokens, attention between prefix and target tokens, attention between target tokens, and masked attention are represented by rounded rectangles in blue, green, yellow, and grey colors, respectively.\n\n### Encoder-Decoder Architecture\n\nBased on the [vanilla Transformer model](https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-the-vanilla-transformer-602d3c57d0db?ref=labellerr.com), the encoder-decoder architecture consists of two stacks of Transformer blocks - an encoder and a decoder.\n\nThe encoder utilizes stacked [multi-head self-attention](https://paperswithcode.com/method/multi-head-attention?ref=labellerr.com) layers to encode the input sequence and generate latent representations. The decoder performs cross-attention on these representations and generates the target sequence.\n\nEncoder-decoder PLMs like [T5](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html?ref=labellerr.com) and [BART](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart?ref=labellerr.com) have demonstrated effectiveness in various NLP tasks. However, only a few LLMs, such as [Flan-T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5?ref=labellerr.com), are built using this architecture.\n\n### Causal Decoder Architecture\n\nThe causal decoder architecture incorporates a [unidirectional attention mask](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/masking-in-transformers-self-attention-mechanism-bad3c9ec235c?ref=labellerr.com), allowing each input token to attend only to past tokens and itself. Both the input and output tokens are processed in the same manner within the decoder.\n\nThe GPT-series models, including GPT-1, GPT-2, and GPT-3, are representative language models built on this architecture. GPT-3 has shown remarkable in-context learning capabilities.\n\nVarious LLMs, including OPT, [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bloom?ref=labellerr.com), and [Gopher](https://gpt3demo.com/apps/deepmind-gopher?ref=labellerr.com) have widely adopted causal decoders.\n\n### Prefix Decoder Architecture\n\nThe prefix decoder architecture, also known as the non-causal decoder, modifies the masking mechanism of causal decoders to enable [bidirectional attention](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-definitive-guide-to-bi-directional-attention-flow-d0e96e9e666b?ref=labellerr.com) over prefix tokens and unidirectional attention on generated tokens.\n\nLike the encoder-decoder architecture, prefix decoders can encode the prefix sequence bidirectionally and predict output tokens autoregressively using shared parameters.\n\nInstead of training from scratch, a practical approach is to train causal decoders and convert them into prefix decoders for faster convergence. LLMs based on prefix decoders include [GLM130B and U-PaLM](https://www.libhunt.com/compare-GLM-130B-vs-PaLM-rlhf-pytorch?ref=labellerr.com).\n\nAll three architecture types can be extended using the [mixture-of-experts (MoE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_of_experts?ref=labellerr.com#:~:text=Mixture%20of%20experts%20(MoE)%20is,combining%20results%20from%20all%20models.) scaling technique, which sparsely activates a subset of neural network weights for each input.\n\nThis approach has been used in models like Switch Transformer and [GLaM](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/12/more-efficient-in-context-learning-with.html?ref=labellerr.com), and increasing the number of experts or the total parameter size has shown significant performance improvements.\n\n### Detailed Configurations\n\nSince introducing the Transformer model, researchers have made several advancements to improve its training stability, performance, and computational efficiency.\n\nIn this section, we will examine the configurations related to four crucial components of the Transformer: normalization, position embeddings, activation functions, and attention and bias.\n\n### Normalization\n\nTo address the issue of training instability in [pre-training Language Models](https://www.labellerr.com/llm?ref=labellerr.com) (LLMs), layer normalization (LN) has been widely used in [Transformer architectures](https://medium.com/inside-machine-learning/what-is-a-transformer-d07dd1fbec04?ref=labellerr.com#:~:text=Like%20LSTM%2C%20Transformer%20is%20an,%2C%20LSTM%2C%20etc.).).\n\nThe position of LN is crucial for LLM performance. While the original Transformer model used post-LN, most LLMs employ pre-LN to achieve more stable training, even though it may slightly decrease performance.\n\nResearchers introduced additional LN layers, known as [Sandwich-LN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11382?ref=labellerr.com), before residual connections to prevent value explosion. However, observations reveal that Sandwich-LN sometimes fails to stabilize LLM training and may cause training collapse.\n\nModels like Gopher and [Chinchilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchilla_AI?ref=labellerr.com) use alternative normalization techniques like [RMS Norm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467?ref=labellerr.com) for faster training and better performance.[GLM-130B](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-130B?ref=labellerr.com) adopts [DeepNorm](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/deepnorm-a-deep-learning-approach-to-text/review/?ref=labellerr.com), which offers better stability in training through post-normalization.\n\nAdding an extra LN after the embedding layer can also stabilize LLM training but often results in a significant performance drop, leading to its exclusion in recent LLMs.\n\n## Activation Functions\n\nTo achieve good performance in feed-forward networks, selecting activation functions is crucial. [GeLU](https://paperswithcode.com/method/gelu?ref=labellerr.com#:~:text=The%20Gaussian%20Error%20Linear%20Unit,x%201%20x%20%3E%200%20).) activations are commonly used in existing LLMs.\n\nFurthermore, recent LLMs such as [PaLM](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html?ref=labellerr.com) and [LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/?ref=labellerr.com) have employed variants of GLU activation, particularly the [SwiGLU](https://paperswithcode.com/method/swiglu?ref=labellerr.com) and GeGLU variants, which have demonstrated better performance in practical applications.\n\n![Activation Function Comparison](https://cdn.labellerr.com/language%20models-4/download.webp)\n\n![Activation Function Comparison](https://cdn.labellerr.com/language%20models-4/download.webp)\n\n**Figure 2**: Activation Function Comparison\n\nHowever, these variants require additional parameters (approximately 50%) in the feed-forward networks compared to GeLU activations.\n\n### Positional Embeddings\n\n[Position embeddings](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-positional-encoding-in-transformer-models-part-1/?ref=labellerr.com) are used in Transformers to incorporate absolute or relative position information in modeling sequences since the self-attention modules are permutation equivariant.\n\nThe vanilla Transformer has two absolute position embeddings: sinusoids and learned position embeddings. LLMs commonly utilize learned position embeddings.\n\nOn the other hand, relative positional encodings generate embeddings based on the offsets between keys and queries. This allows them to perform well on longer sequences, even ones beyond the lengths encountered during training, enabling extrapolation.\n\nALiBi introduces a penalty based on the distance between keys and queries to bias attention scores, resulting in better zero-shot generalization and stronger extrapolation capabilities than other position embeddings.\n\n[RoPE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09864.pdf?ref=labellerr.com), on the other hand, uses rotatory matrices based on absolute positions to compute scores between keys and queries, incorporating relative position information for modeling long sequences. Recent LLMs widely adopt RoPE as a consequence of its benefits.\n\n![Positional Embedding](https://cdn.labellerr.com/language%20models-4/PE1-1024x545.webp)\n\n![Positional Embedding](https://cdn.labellerr.com/language%20models-4/PE1-1024x545.webp)\n\n**Figure 3:** Positional Embedding\n\n### Attention and Bias\n\nIn addition to the full self-attention mechanism in the original Transformer, GPT-3 utilizes sparse attention, specifically [Factorized Attention](https://paperswithcode.com/method/fixed-factorized-attention?ref=labellerr.com), to reduce computation complexity.\n\nResearchers explore various approaches to effectively model longer sequences, including introducing special attention patterns or optimizing GPU memory access, as seen in models like [FlashAttention.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135?ref=labellerr.com)\n\nMoreover, while biases are typically included in each dense kernel and [Layer Norm](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LayerNorm.html?ref=labellerr.com) following the original Transformer, recent LLMs like PaLM and [Galactica](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09085?ref=labellerr.com) have removed biases. Removing biases improves training stability in LLMs, as demonstrated in studies.\n\n![Detailed formulations for the network configurations.](https://cdn.labellerr.com/language%20models-4/Screenshot%202023-05-21%20233405.webp)Detailed formulations for the network configurations.\n\n![Detailed formulations for the network configurations.](https://cdn.labellerr.com/language%20models-4/Screenshot%202023-05-21%20233405.webp)\n\n**Figure 4**: Detailed formulations for the network configurations.\n\nTo summarize the suggestions from existing literature regarding detailed configuration for Language Models (LLMs): for stronger generalization and training stability, it is recommended to use [pre-RMS Norm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467?ref=labellerr.com) for layer normalization and SwiGLU or GeGLU as the activation function.\n\nIt is advised not to use LN immediately after embedding layers as it may lead to performance degradation.\n\nRegarding position embeddings, RoPE or ALiBi is a better choice as they perform well on long sequences.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have changed how we solve natural language tasks, thanks to improvements in their design and training methods.

This article delves into the architecture, training methods, and practical applications of LLMs. We’ll explore the core components that make these models so powerful and explain how they are trained and fine-tuned for real-world use cases.\n\n## **1. Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)** [#](#1-introduction-to-large-language-models-llms)\n\n### **Definition and Importance of LLMs** [#](#definition-and-importance-of-llms)\n\nLarge Language Models are advanced deep learning models trained on massive amounts of text data. LLMs have made it possible to perform a wide variety of natural language tasks, from answering complex questions to generating human-like responses in chat applications. These models use billions (sometimes trillions) of parameters to capture intricate relationships within language, enabling them to comprehend and generate coherent responses.\n\nLLMs play an instrumental role across diverse applications, such as content creation, automated customer support, and scientific research. The sheer size and training complexity of these models equip them with a nuanced understanding of language, transforming how we interact with machines.\n\n### **Evolution and Milestones in LLM Development** [#](#evolution-and-milestones-in-llm-development)\n\nThe development of LLMs has advanced rapidly, with some key milestones including:\n\nThe latest models like **GPT-4** and **Claude** continue this trend, with billions of parameters enabling them to tackle more complex tasks across domains like healthcare, finance, and scientific discovery.\n\n### **Significance of LLMs in Modern AI Applications** [#](#significance-of-llms-in-modern-ai-applications)\n\nLLMs power many applications across industries. For example, in healthcare, LLMs assist in summarizing medical records and providing insights into patient data. In customer service, they enable chatbots to handle inquiries with a human-like response. Such applications demonstrate how LLMs reshape business processes by enhancing efficiency and improving user experiences.\n\n## **2. Core Architectures of LLMs** [#](#2-core-architectures-of-llms)\n\n### **Transformers: The Foundation of LLMs** [#](#transformers-the-foundation-of-llms)\n\nThe **Transformer** architecture, introduced in 2017, underpins most modern LLMs. Its defining feature is the **self-attention mechanism**, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when predicting the next token. This mechanism provides the model with a global context for each word, allowing it to make connections across long text sequences efficiently.\n\nTransformers are structured around **multi-head attention**, **position-wise feed-forward networks**, and **residual connections**, which enable them to capture complex dependencies between words. This structure allows LLMs to process large amounts of text data efficiently and effectively.\n\n### **Key Models and Differences (BERT, GPT, and T5)** [#](#key-models-and-differences-bert-gpt-and-t5)\n\nEach of these models brings unique strengths to NLP tasks:\n\n### **Attention Mechanisms** [#](#attention-mechanisms)\n\nAt the heart of Transformer-based models is the **attention mechanism**, which enables models to focus on specific words that are contextually relevant. The **self-attention** process allows each word to attend to every other word in a sentence, building richer representations of language.\n\n**Multi-head attention** extends this process by allowing multiple attention mechanisms to operate in parallel, with each head focusing on different aspects of the context. This is especially useful for complex, nuanced tasks requiring long-range dependencies, like summarizing lengthy documents.\n\n### **Encoder-Decoder Architectures vs. Autoregressive Models** [#](#encoder-decoder-architectures-vs-autoregressive-models)\n\nTwo main architectures dominate LLM design:\n\n## **3. Components of LLM Training** [#](#3-components-of-llm-training)\n\n### **Data Collection and Preprocessing** [#](#data-collection-and-preprocessing)\n\nTraining LLMs requires vast, high-quality datasets sourced from books, websites, academic papers, and other text-rich sources. Key steps include:\n\n### **Tokenization: Vocabulary Choices and Byte-Pair Encoding** [#](#tokenization-vocabulary-choices-and-byte-pair-encoding)\n\nTokenization divides text into smaller units, or tokens, for model processing. In LLMs, **subword tokenization** is widely used, enabling models to handle rare or complex words by breaking them into meaningful parts. Methods like **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)** or **SentencePiece** balance vocabulary size with flexibility, allowing LLMs to work effectively across languages or specialized domains.\n\n### **Training Objectives: Masked and Causal Language Modeling** [#](#training-objectives-masked-and-causal-language-modeling)\n\nLLMs are typically trained with one of two objectives:\n\nThese objectives help the model learn to understand and generate language effectively for different types of tasks.\n\n## **4. LLM Fine-tuning Approaches** [#](#4-llm-fine-tuning-approaches)\n\nFine-tuning is a critical step in adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains. Rather than training a model from scratch, which is resource-intensive, fine-tuning leverages the extensive, pre-trained knowledge base of a model and adapts it for specialized needs. Here, we explore popular approaches to fine-tuning LLMs.\n\n### **Approaches to Fine-tuning LLMs** [#](#approaches-to-fine-tuning-llms)\n\n**Full Model Fine-tuning**: All layers and parameters are updated during the fine-tuning process. This approach is effective for highly specialized tasks but requires significant computational resources, as each layer is adjusted to the new task’s data.\n\n**Feature-Based Fine-tuning**: Here, the model’s pre-trained layers act as feature extractors, and only the final layer (or a few layers) is fine-tuned. This approach is less resource-intensive and is useful when the downstream task is relatively similar to the original training data.\n\n**Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning**: Techniques like **Adapter Layers** and **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** add smaller, task-specific parameters to the model while freezing most of the original weights. This method is more efficient, as only the new parameters are updated during training, making it suitable for tasks with limited data or computational resources.\n\n**Prompt Tuning**: Also known as **prompt-based fine-tuning**, this approach involves prepending specific prompts to inputs without modifying the model’s architecture or weights. The model’s responses are adapted to the task based on these engineered prompts, providing a lightweight alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.\n\n### Modern fine-tuning approaches [#](#modern-fine-tuning-approaches)\n\n**Quantization**: Reduces model size by using lower-precision formats for weights and activations, such as 8-bit or even 4-bit representations. This reduces memory footprint and can speed up inference significantly without major accuracy losses.\n\n**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: Focuses on tuning only a small subset of parameters, leaving the majority of the model’s parameters untouched. This approach helps make fine-tuning more accessible and computationally efficient, especially for large models.\n\n**Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: Inserts low-rank matrices into the model’s architecture to adapt it without modifying the main parameters. LoRA effectively introduces additional trainable parameters that can learn task-specific features, making it highly efficient for fine-tuning.\n\n### **Selecting Layers to Update** [#](#selecting-layers-to-update)\n\nThe decision of which layers to fine-tune depends on the specific task and available resources:\n\n### **Weight Adjustments During Fine-tuning** [#](#weight-adjustments-during-fine-tuning)\n\nUpdating weights during fine-tuning requires a balance to prevent **catastrophic forgetting** (whereby the model “forgets” its pre-trained knowledge). Techniques like **learning rate scheduling** and **gradient clipping** can help maintain the model’s pre-existing strengths while learning new information.\n\n## **5. Training Infrastructure for Large Language Models** [#](#5-training-infrastructure-for-large-language-models)\n\nLLMs require extensive computational resources, often involving complex infrastructures that include GPUs, TPUs, and specialized cloud-based platforms.\n\n### **Distributed Computing for Large-scale Training** [#](#distributed-computing-for-large-scale-training)\n\nLarge models cannot fit in the memory of a single machine. **Distributed training** splits the model across multiple GPUs or TPUs, allowing parallel processing of data and gradient updates across machines. Techniques like **model parallelism** and **data parallelism** help accelerate training by efficiently dividing work across systems.\n\n### **Specialized Hardware: GPUs and TPUs** [#](#specialized-hardware-gpus-and-tpus)\n\nGPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) are specialized hardware for handling large matrix operations efficiently, which are common in neural network training. TPUs, designed by Google specifically for machine learning, can achieve high performance in training and inferencing tasks, especially with larger LLMs.\n\n### **Efficient Training Methods** [#](#efficient-training-methods)\n\nTo optimize training, methods such as **mixed-precision training** (which uses lower-precision floats for computations) and **gradient checkpointing** (saving memory by only storing essential gradient data) reduce resource consumption without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n### **Scalable and Cost-effective Cloud Solutions** [#](#scalable-and-cost-effective-cloud-solutions)\n\nPublic cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) provide scalable solutions to train LLMs cost-effectively. Cloud-based solutions offer flexibility to scale resources up or down, making them suitable for organizations of all sizes and facilitating collaboration among distributed teams.\n\n## **6. Evaluation and Benchmarking** [#](#6-evaluation-and-benchmarking)\n\nBenchmarks provide standard measures for evaluating model performance on various tasks, guiding model development and helping compare different LLMs on a common scale.\n\n### **What Are Benchmarks in AI?** [#](#what-are-benchmarks-in-ai)\n\nBenchmarks are curated datasets and tasks used to measure a model’s abilities across specific challenges (e.g., reasoning, knowledge retrieval, translation). They ensure models meet the quality and capability standards required for real-world deployment.\n\n### **Key Components of AI Benchmarks** [#](#key-components-of-ai-benchmarks)\n\nA robust benchmark typically includes:\n\n### **Importance of Benchmarks** [#](#importance-of-benchmarks)\n\nBenchmarks provide a structured approach to evaluating progress in LLM development, ensuring models improve in areas of practical importance, such as accuracy, speed, and robustness. They help users select models suited to their needs and guide model development in industry and academia.\n\n### **Example Benchmarks in Practice** [#](#example-benchmarks-in-practice)\n\nPopular LLM benchmarks include:\n\n## **7. Popular LLM Benchmarks and n-shot Learning** [#](#7-popular-llm-benchmarks-and-n-shot-learning)\n\nn-shot learning assesses how well a model adapts to new tasks with limited training data, typically in settings like zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning.\n\n### **What Is n-shot Learning?** [#](#what-is-n-shot-learning)\n\nn-shot learning is an evaluation paradigm in which models are provided with **n** examples to help them understand the target task:\n\n### **Applications of n-shot Learning in LLM Benchmarks** [#](#applications-of-n-shot-learning-in-llm-benchmarks)\n\nn-shot settings, particularly **few-shot**, are commonly used in LLM benchmarks like MMLU and Big-Bench. These benchmarks assess a model’s flexibility and its ability to generalize with minimal information, which is crucial for applications where annotated data is scarce.\n\n### 8. **LLM Fine-tuning Approaches** [#](#8-llm-fine-tuning-approaches)\n\nFine-tuning large language models (LLMs) involves adjusting specific model parameters to tailor the LLM to a particular task or domain. The goal is to refine the model without the heavy computational cost of training all parameters from scratch. Here are some of the key fine-tuning techniques:\n\n**Standard Fine-Tuning**: This approach involves updating all or most model parameters using labeled data relevant to the target task. While highly effective, it requires significant computational resources, especially for large models.\n\n**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: This technique updates only a subset of parameters, reducing memory and processing needs. PEFT is particularly advantageous in low-resource or low-power environments, where tuning a full LLM isn’t feasible.\n\n**Quantization**: Quantization compresses model weights to lower-precision formats, such as 8-bit or even 4-bit, to reduce memory usage and improve inference speed. While initially popular for inference, quantization is now also being used in fine-tuning, making it possible to train large models on less powerful hardware.\n\n**Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: LoRA is a method that inserts additional low-rank matrices into transformer layers. This allows the model to learn task-specific changes while leaving the original model parameters mostly untouched. LoRA is particularly useful in transfer learning, as it maintains model integrity while achieving effective fine-tuning.\n\n**Adapters**: Adapters are lightweight layers added to each layer of the transformer. By training only the adapter layers and keeping the core model frozen, we save time and computational resources. This method is highly modular, allowing a single model to be adapted to various tasks by simply switching adapters.\n\n### 9. **Evaluation Metrics for LLMs** [#](#9-evaluation-metrics-for-llms)\n\nEvaluating large language models (LLMs) accurately is crucial to ensure they perform well across diverse use cases. The right metrics offer insight into the model’s accuracy, coherence, relevance, and ethical implications. Here are some key metrics used to evaluate LLMs:\n\n**Perplexity**: Measures how well the model predicts a sample of text. Lower perplexity indicates better model performance, showing that the model generates fluent, plausible sequences.\n\n**BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** and **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**: Commonly used in text generation and summarization, these metrics compare generated text with human references to determine closeness in terms of wording and structure.\n\n**Accuracy & F1 Score**: For tasks like classification and QA, accuracy and F1 scores measure the model’s precision and recall. These are often employed when the model output has a right/wrong answer, such as fact-based questions.\n\n**Human Evaluation**: Human assessments are vital for subjective attributes like coherence, appropriateness, and sentiment. Evaluators rate model outputs based on these qualitative aspects, often forming a critical component of LLM evaluation.\n\n**Ethical and Bias Metrics**: These metrics evaluate the model’s tendency to reinforce harmful stereotypes, generate offensive content, or exhibit undesirable biases. Fairness metrics like demographic parity and bias amplification are used to assess the ethical implications of a model’s outputs.\n\n### 10. **Challenges and Limitations in LLM Training** [#](#10-challenges-and-limitations-in-llm-training)\n\nDespite their transformative potential, LLMs come with several challenges and limitations. Here are some of the most significant:\n\n**Computational Costs**: Training LLMs requires significant computational resources, particularly when dealing with very large models or massive datasets. The hardware, energy, and storage demands can be prohibitive, often limiting LLM training to organizations with substantial resources.\n\n**Data Privacy and Security**: Training on massive, diverse datasets raises concerns about privacy and security. Models can unintentionally memorize sensitive information from training data, leading to potential privacy violations. Ensuring data integrity and anonymization in training data is critical.\n\n**Bias and Fairness**: LLMs trained on unfiltered internet data often reflect societal biases, as they learn from a vast array of human-generated content. Addressing bias requires careful curation of training datasets, post-processing techniques, and ongoing monitoring of outputs.\n\n**Interpretability and Explainability**: As models become larger and more complex, interpreting their predictions and explaining decision-making becomes increasingly difficult. Explainability is especially crucial for applications in high-stakes fields like healthcare, law, and finance.\n\n**Generalization vs. Overfitting**: Striking the right balance between generalization (performing well on diverse inputs) and overfitting (memorizing training data) is difficult with LLMs. While more data can reduce overfitting, it requires careful validation to ensure the model doesn’t simply “remember” data.\n\n![Dr. Hari Thapliyaal's avatar](/assets/images/myphotos/Profilephoto1.jpg)\n\n#### Dr. Hari Thapliyaal\n\nDr. Hari Thapliyal is a seasoned professional and prolific blogger with a multifaceted background that spans the realms of Data Science, Project Management, and Advait-Vedanta Philosophy.

At first glance, looking back at GPT-2 (2019) and forward to DeepSeek-V3 and Llama 4 (2024-2025), one might be surprised at how structurally similar these models still are.\n\nSure, positional embeddings have evolved from absolute to rotational (RoPE), Multi-Head Attention has largely given way to Grouped-Query Attention, and the more efficient SwiGLU has replaced activation functions like GELU. But beneath these minor refinements, have we truly seen groundbreaking changes, or are we simply polishing the same architectural foundations?\n\nComparing LLMs to determine the key ingredients that contribute to their good (or not-so-good) performance is notoriously challenging: datasets, training techniques, and hyperparameters vary widely and are often not well documented.\n\nHowever, I think that there is still a lot of value in examining the structural changes of the architectures themselves to see what LLM developers are up to in 2025. (A subset of them are shown in Figure 1 below.)\n\n[![Image 9](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iCn-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ae4aa85-3e22-486c-9bd9-27edc4acbf8b_3000x2093.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iCn-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ae4aa85-3e22-486c-9bd9-27edc4acbf8b_3000x2093.png)\n\nFigure 1: A subset of the architectures covered in this article.\n\nSo, in this article, rather than writing about benchmark performance or training algorithms, I will focus on the architectural developments that define today\'s flagship open models.\n\n(As you may remember, [I wrote about multimodal LLMs](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/understanding-multimodal-llms) not too long ago; in this article, I will focus on the text capabilities of recent models and leave the discussion of multimodal capabilities for another time.)\n\n**Tip:** This is a fairly comprehensive article, so I recommend using the navigation bar to access the table of contents (just hover over the left side of the Substack page).\n\n1. DeepSeek V3/R1\n=================\n\nAs you have probably heard more than once by now, [DeepSeek R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948) made a big impact when it was released in January 2025. DeepSeek R1 is a reasoning model built on top of the [DeepSeek V3 architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19437), which was introduced in December 2024.\n\nWhile my focus here is on architectures released in 2025, I think it’s reasonable to include DeepSeek V3, since it only gained widespread attention and adoption following the launch of DeepSeek R1 in 2025.\n\nIf you are interested in the training of DeepSeek R1 specifically, you may also find my article from earlier this year useful:\n\n[![Image 10: Understanding Reasoning LLMs](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QwUc!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6ebc5c9-461f-4d3a-889b-b8ea4e14e5ba_1600x830.png) #### Understanding Reasoning LLMs [Sebastian Raschka, PhD](https://substack.com/profile/27393275-sebastian-raschka-phd) · Feb 5 [Read full story](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/understanding-reasoning-llms)](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/understanding-reasoning-llms)\n\nIn this section, I’ll focus on two key architectural techniques introduced in DeepSeek V3 that improved its computational efficiency and distinguish it from many other LLMs:\n\n*   Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)\n\n*   Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\n\n**1.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nBefore discussing Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), let\'s briefly go over some background to motivate why it\'s used. For that, let\'s start with Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), which has become the new standard replacement for a more compute- and parameter-efficient alternative to Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in recent years.\n\nSo, here\'s a brief GQA summary. Unlike MHA, where each head also has its own set of keys and values, to reduce memory usage, GQA groups multiple heads to share the same key and value projections.\n\nFor example, as further illustrated in Figure 2 below, if there are 2 key-value groups and 4 attention heads, then heads 1 and 2 might share one set of keys and values, while heads 3 and 4 share another. This reduces the total number of key and value computations, which leads to lower memory usage and improved efficiency (without noticeably affecting the modeling performance, according to ablation studies).\n\n[![Image 11](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uVhV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F647caf83-cd3d-46f8-8bd0-0946bd896ea1_1023x474.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uVhV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F647caf83-cd3d-46f8-8bd0-0946bd896ea1_1023x474.png)\n\n_Figure 2: A comparison between MHA and GQA. Here, the group size is 2, where a key and value pair is shared among 2 queries._\n\nSo, the core idea behind GQA is to reduce the number of key and value heads by sharing them across multiple query heads. This (1) lowers the model\'s parameter count and (2) reduces the memory bandwidth usage for key and value tensors during inference since fewer keys and values need to be stored and retrieved from the KV cache.\n\n(If you are curious how GQA looks in code, see my[GPT-2 to Llama 3 conversion guide](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/ch05/07_gpt_to_llama/converting-llama2-to-llama3.ipynb) for a version without KV cache and my KV-cache variant [here](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/pkg/llms_from_scratch/llama3.py).)\n\nWhile GQA is mainly a computational-efficiency workaround for MHA, ablation studies (such as those in the[original GQA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13245) and the [Llama 2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288)) show it performs comparably to standard MHA in terms of LLM modeling performance.\n\nNow, Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers a different memory-saving strategy that also pairs particularly well with KV caching. Instead of sharing key and value heads like GQA, MLA compresses the key and value tensors into a lower-dimensional space before storing them in the KV cache.\n\nAt inference time, these compressed tensors are projected back to their original size before being used, as shown in the Figure 3 below. This adds an extra matrix multiplication but reduces memory usage.\n\n[![Image 12](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jagJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb9a75be-2848-4b99-af3d-4c48bdd0181a_1550x858.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jagJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb9a75be-2848-4b99-af3d-4c48bdd0181a_1550x858.png)\n\n_Figure 3: Comparison between MLA (used in DeepSeek V3 and R1) and regular MHA._\n\n(As a side note, the queries are also compressed, but only during training, not inference.)\n\nBy the way, MLA is not new in DeepSeek V3, as its [DeepSeek-V2 predecessor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434) also used (and even introduced) it. Also, the V2 paper contains a few interesting ablation studies that may explain why the DeepSeek team chose MLA over GQA (see Figure 4 below).\n\n[![Image 13](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!efDX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b7e646a-16c1-4245-9a3f-55a41f3070c2_903x856.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!efDX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b7e646a-16c1-4245-9a3f-55a41f3070c2_903x856.png)\n\nFigure 4: Annotated tables from the DeepSeek-V2 paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434\n\nAs shown in Figure 4 above, GQA appears to perform worse than MHA, whereas MLA offers better modeling performance than MHA, which is likely why the DeepSeek team chose MLA over GQA. (It would have been interesting to see the "KV Cache per Token" savings comparison between MLA and GQA as well!)\n\nTo summarize this section before we move on to the next architecture component, MLA is a clever trick to reduce KV cache memory use while even slightly outperforming MHA in terms of modeling performance.\n\n**1.2 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**\n--------------------------------\n\nThe other major architectural component in DeepSeek worth highlighting is its use of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers. While DeepSeek did not invent MoE, it has seen a resurgence this year, and many of the architectures we will cover later also adopt it.\n\nYou are likely already familiar with MoE, but a quick recap may be helpful.\n\nThe core idea in MoE is to replace each FeedForward module in a transformer block with multiple expert layers, where each of these expert layers is also a FeedForward module. This means that we swap a single FeedForward block for multiple FeedForward blocks, as illustrated in the Figure 5 below.\n\n[![Image 14](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e3O4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4efdd493-d8c8-4038-ad24-20d6db86eae8_1600x1009.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e3O4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4efdd493-d8c8-4038-ad24-20d6db86eae8_1600x1009.png)\n\n_Figure 5: An illustration of the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module in DeepSeek V3/R1 (right) compared to an LLM with a standard FeedForward block (left)._\n\nThe FeedForward block inside a transformer block (shown as the dark gray block in the figure above) typically contains a large number of the model\'s total parameters. (Note that the transformer block, and thereby the FeedForward block, is repeated many times in an LLM; in the case of DeepSeek-V3, 61 times.)\n\nSo, replacing _a single_ FeedForward block with _multiple_ FeedForward blocks (as done in a MoE setup) substantially increases the model\'s total parameter count. However, the key trick is that we don\'t use ("activate") all experts for every token. Instead, a router selects only a small subset of experts per token. (In the interest of time, or rather article space, I\'ll cover the router in more detail another time.)\n\nBecause only a few experts are active at a time, MoE modules are often referred to as _sparse_, in contrast to _dense_ modules that always use the full parameter set. However, the large total number of parameters via an MoE increases the capacity of the LLM, which means it can take up more knowledge during training. The sparsity keeps inference efficient, though, as we don\'t use all the parameters at the same time.\n\nFor example, DeepSeek-V3 has 256 experts per MoE module and a total of 671 billion parameters. Yet during inference, only 9 experts are active at a time (1 shared expert plus 8 selected by the router). This means just 37 billion parameters are used per inference step as opposed to all 671 billion.\n\nOne notable feature of DeepSeek-V3\'s MoE design is the use of a shared expert. This is an expert that is always active for every token. This idea is not new and was already introduced in the [DeepSeek 2024 MoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06066) and [2022 DeepSpeedMoE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05596)s.\n\n[![Image 15](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!i4ms!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d93c441-a6d2-4257-bd80-2d3590c4001c_1039x569.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!i4ms!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d93c441-a6d2-4257-bd80-2d3590c4001c_1039x569.png)\n\n_Figure 6: An annotated figure from "DeepSeekMoE: Towards Ultimate Expert Specialization in Mixture-of-Experts Language Models", https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06066_\n\nThe benefit of having a shared expert was first noted in the [DeepSpeedMoE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05596), where they found that it boosts overall modeling performance compared to no shared experts. This is likely because common or repeated patterns don\'t have to be learned by multiple individual experts, which leaves them with more room for learning more specialized patterns.\n\n**1.3 DeepSeek Summary**\n------------------------\n\nTo summarize, DeepSeek-V3 is a massive 671-billion-parameter model that, at launch, outperformed other open-weight models, including the 405B Llama 3. Despite being larger, it is much more efficient at inference time thanks to its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which activates only a small subset of (just 37B) parameters per token.\n\nAnother key distinguishing feature is DeepSeek-V3\'s use of Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) instead of Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). Both MLA and GQA are inference-efficient alternatives to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), particularly when using KV caching. While MLA is more complex to implement, a study in the DeepSeek-V2 paper has shown it delivers better modeling performance than GQA.\n\n2. OLMo 2\n=========\n\nThe OLMo series of models by the non-profit Allen Institute for AI is noteworthy due to its transparency in terms of training data and code, as well as the relatively detailed technical reports.\n\nWhile you probably won’t find OLMo models at the top of any benchmark or leaderboard, they are pretty clean and, more importantly, a great blueprint for developing LLMs, thanks to their transparency.\n\nAnd while OLMo models are popular because of their transparency, they are not that bad either. In fact, at the time of release in January (before Llama 4, Gemma 3, and Qwen 3), [OLMo 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00656) models were sitting at the Pareto frontier of compute to performance, as shown in Figure 7 below.\n\n[![Image 16](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7DYj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb5c7281-eded-4319-9ae2-7b07478a86b2_1027x823.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7DYj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb5c7281-eded-4319-9ae2-7b07478a86b2_1027x823.png)\n\nFigure 7: Modeling benchmark performance (higher is better) vs pre-training cost (FLOPs; lower is better) for different LLMs. This is an annotated figure from the OLMo 2 paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00656\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, I aim to focus only on the LLM architecture details (not training or data) to keep it at a manageable length. So, what were the interesting architectural design choices in OLMo2 ? It mainly comes down to normalizations: the placement of RMSNorm layers as well as the addition of a QK-norm, which I will discuss below.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that OLMo 2 still uses traditional Multi-Head Attention (MHA) instead of MLA or GQA.\n\n**2.1 Normalization Layer Placement**\n-------------------------------------\n\nOverall, OLMo 2 largely follows the architecture of the original GPT model, similar to other contemporary LLMs. However, there are some noteworthy deviations. Let\'s start with the normalization layers.\n\nSimilar to Llama, Gemma, and most other LLMs, OLMo 2 switched from LayerNorm to RMSNorm.\n\nBut since RMSNorm is old hat (it\'s basically a simplified version of LayerNorm with fewer trainable parameters), I will skip the discussion of RMSNorm vs LayerNorm. (Curious readers can find an RMSNorm code implementation in my [GPT-2 to Llama conversion guide](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/ch05/07_gpt_to_llama/converting-gpt-to-llama2.ipynb).)\n\nHowever, it\'s worth discussing the placement of the RMSNorm layer. The original transformer (from the "[Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)" paper) placed the two normalization layers in the transformer block _after_ the attention module and the FeedForward module, respectively.\n\nThis is also known as Post-LN or Post-Norm.\n\nGPT and most other LLMs that came after placed the normalization layers _before_ the attention and FeedForward modules, which is known as Pre-LN or Pre-Norm. A comparison between Post- and Pre-Norm is shown in the figure below.\n\n[![Image 17](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wYj9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61a4560f-d97f-4c78-a7a3-765babb45bec_1444x789.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wYj9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61a4560f-d97f-4c78-a7a3-765babb45bec_1444x789.png)\n\n_Figure 8: A comparison of Post-Norm, Pre-Norm, and OLMo 2\'s flavor of Post-Norm._\n\nIn [2020, Xiong et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04745) showed that Pre-LN results in more well-behaved gradients at initialization. Furthermore, the researchers mentioned that Pre-LN even works well without careful learning rate warm-up, which is otherwise a crucial tool for Post-LN.\n\nNow, the reason I am mentioning that is that OLMo 2 adopted a form of Post-LN (but with RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm, so I am calling it _Post-Norm_).\n\nIn OLMo 2, instead of placing the normalization layers before the attention and FeedForward layers, they place them after, as shown in the figure above. However, notice that in contrast to the original transformer architecture, the normalization layers are still inside the residual layers (skip connections).\n\nSo, why did they move the position of the normalization layers?The reason is that it helped with training stability, as shown in the figure below.\n\n[![Image 18](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ebW0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F186190ec-2ae5-430d-b0d4-a63486e0f3fb_1289x407.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ebW0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F186190ec-2ae5-430d-b0d4-a63486e0f3fb_1289x407.png)\n\n_Figure 9: A plot showing the training stability for Pre-Norm (like in GPT-2, Llama 3, and many others) versus OLMo 2\'s flavor of Post-Norm._\n\nUnfortunately this figure shows the results of the reordering together with QK-Norm, which is a separate concept. So, it’s hard to tell how much the normalization layer reordering contributed by itself.\n\n**2.2 QK-Norm**\n---------------\n\nSince the previous section already mentioned the QK-norm, and other LLMs we discuss later, such as Gemma 2 and Gemma 3, also use QK-norm, let\'s briefly discuss what this is.\n\nQK-Norm is essentially yet another RMSNorm layer. It\'s placed inside the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) module and applied to the queries (q) and keys (k) before applying RoPE. To illustrate this, below is an excerpt of a Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) layer I wrote for my [Qwen3 from-scratch implementation](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch05/11_qwen3) (the QK-norm application in GQA is similar to MHA in OLMo):\n\n```\nclass GroupedQueryAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(\n        self, d_in, num_heads, num_kv_groups,\n        head_dim=None, qk_norm=False, dtype=None\n    ):\n        # ...\n\n        if qk_norm:\n            self.q_norm = RMSNorm(head_dim, eps=1e-6)\n            self.k_norm = RMSNorm(head_dim, eps=1e-6)\n        else:\n            self.q_norm = self.k_norm = None\n\n    def forward(self, x, mask, cos, sin):\n        b, num_tokens, _ = x.shape\n\n        # Apply projections\n        queries = self.W_query(x) \n        keys = self.W_key(x)\n        values = self.W_value(x) \n\n        # ...\n\n        # Optional normalization\n        if self.q_norm:\n            queries = self.q_norm(queries)\n        if self.k_norm:\n            keys = self.k_norm(keys)\n\n        # Apply RoPE\n        queries = apply_rope(queries, cos, sin)\n        keys = apply_rope(keys, cos, sin)\n\n        # Expand K and V to match number of heads\n        keys = keys.repeat_interleave(self.group_size, dim=1)\n        values = values.repeat_interleave(self.group_size, dim=1)\n\n        # Attention\n        attn_scores = queries @ keys.transpose(2, 3)\n        # ...\n```\n\nAs mentioned earlier, together with Post-Norm, QK-Norm stabilizes the training. Note that QK-Norm was not invented by OLMo 2 but goes back to the [2023 Scaling Vision Transformers paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05442).\n\n**2.3 OLMo 2 Summary**\n----------------------\n\nIn short, the noteworthy OLMo 2 architecture design decisions are primarily the RMSNorm placements: RMSNorm after instead of before the attention and FeedForward modules (a flavor of Post-Norm), as well as the addition of RMSNorm for the queries and keys inside the attention mechanism (QK-Norm), which both, together, help stabilize the training loss.\n\nBelow is a figure that further compares OLMo 2 to Llama 3 side by side; as one can see, the architectures are otherwise relatively similar except for the fact that OLMo 2 still uses the traditional MHA instead of GQA. (However, the [OLMo 2 team released a 32B variant](https://huggingface.co/allenai/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct) 3 months later that uses GQA.)\n\n[![Image 19](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S6Y9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fa42974-cfae-45cc-9cd9-fc1d9607d386_1329x737.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S6Y9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fa42974-cfae-45cc-9cd9-fc1d9607d386_1329x737.png)\n\nFigure 10: An architecture comparison between Llama 3 and OLMo 2.\n\n3. Gemma 3\n==========\n\nGoogle\'s Gemma models have always been really good, and I think they have always been a bit underhyped compared to other popular models, like the Llama series.\n\nOne of the distinguishing aspects of Gemma is the rather large vocabulary size (to support multiple languages better), and the stronger focus on the 27B size (versus 8B or 70B). But note that Gemma 2 also comes in smaller sizes: 1B, 4B, and 12B.\n\nThe 27B size hits a really nice sweet spot: it\'s much more capable than an 8B model but not as resource-intensive as a 70B model, and it runs just fine locally on my Mac Mini.\n\nSo, what else is interesting in [Gemma 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19786)? As discussed earlier, other models like Deepseek-V3/R1 use a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to reduce memory requirements at inference, given a fixed model size. (The MoE approach is also used by several other models we will discuss later.)\n\nGemma 3 uses a different "trick" to reduce computational costs, namely sliding window attention.\n\n**3.1 Sliding Window Attention**\n--------------------------------\n\nWith sliding window attention (originally introduced in the [LongFormer paper in 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150) and also already used by [Gemma 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00118)), the Gemma 3 team was able to reduce the memory requirements in the KV cache by a substantial amount, as shown in the figure below.\n\n[![Image 20](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LQA4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5363ce6-0ec8-49e6-b296-9836c248e159_665x302.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LQA4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5363ce6-0ec8-49e6-b296-9836c248e159_665x302.png)\n\n_Figure 11: An annotated figure from Gemma 3 paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19786) showing the KV cache memory savings via sliding window attention._\n\nSo, what is sliding window attention? If we think of regular self-attention as a _global_ attention mechanism, since each sequence element can access every other sequence element, then we can think of sliding window attention as _local_ attention, because here we restrict the context size around the current query position. This is illustrated in the figure below.\n\n[![Image 21](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tTJ5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff32c2d74-ec34-43ef-86bc-bcce832426b3_1600x792.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tTJ5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff32c2d74-ec34-43ef-86bc-bcce832426b3_1600x792.png)\n\n_Figure 12: A comparison between regular attention (left) and sliding window attention (right)._\n\nPlease note that sliding window attention can be used with both Multi-Head Attention and Grouped-Query Attention; Gemma 3 uses grouped-query attention.\n\nAs mentioned above, sliding window attention is also referred to as _local_ attention because the local window surrounds and moves with the current query position. In contrast, regular attention is _global_ as each token can access all other tokens.\n\nNow, as briefly mentioned above, the Gemma 2 predecessor architecture also used sliding window attention before. The difference in Gemma 3 is that they adjusted the ratio between global (regular) and local (sliding) attention.\n\nFor instance, Gemma 2 uses a hybrid attention mechanism that combines sliding window (local) and global attention in a 1:1 ratio. Each token can attend to a 4k-token window of nearby context.\n\nWhere Gemma 2 used sliding window attention in every other layer, Gemma 3 now has a 5:1 ratio, meaning there\'s only 1 full attention layer for every 5 sliding windows (local) attention layers; moreover, the sliding window size was reduced from 4096 (Gemma 2) to just 1024 (Gemma 3). This shifts the model\'s focus towards more efficient, localized computations.\n\nAccording to their ablation study, the use of sliding window attention has minimal impact on modeling performance, as shown in the figure below.\n\n[![Image 22](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSZb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F788a5023-1ba3-4372-89cd-4ebeff132255_1600x477.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSZb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F788a5023-1ba3-4372-89cd-4ebeff132255_1600x477.png)\n\nFigure 13: An annotated figure from Gemma 3 paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19786) showing that sliding window attention has little to no impact on the LLM-generated output perplexity.\n\nWhile sliding window attention is the most notable architecture aspect of Gemma 3, I want to also briefly go over the placement of the normalization layers as a follow-up to the previous OLMo 2 section.\n\n**3.2 Normalization Layer Placement in Gemma 3**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nA small but interesting tidbit to highlight is that Gemma 3 uses RMSNorm in both a Pre-Norm and Post-Norm setting around its grouped-query attention module.\n\nThis is similar to Gemma 2 but still worth highlighting, as it differs from (1) the Post-Norm used in the original transformer (“Attention is all you need”), (2) the Pre-Norm, which was popularized by GPT-2 and used in many other architectures afterwards, and (3) the Post-Norm flavor in OLMo 2 that we saw earlier.\n\n[![Image 23](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!A1BM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F752ec4b7-2720-44f8-958b-0ca85b3a96f1_1068x855.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!A1BM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F752ec4b7-2720-44f8-958b-0ca85b3a96f1_1068x855.png)\n\n_Figure 14: An architecture comparison between OLMo2 and Gemma 3; note the additional normalization layers in Gemma 3._\n\nI think this normalization layer placement is a relatively intuitive approach as it gets the best of both worlds: Pre-Norm and Post-Norm. In my opinion, a bit of extra normalization can\'t hurt. In the worst case, if the extra normalization is redundant, this adds a bit of inefficiency through redundancy. In practice, since RMSNorm is relatively cheap in the grand scheme of things, this shouldn\'t have any noticeable impact, though.\n\n**3.3 Gemma 3 Summary**\n-----------------------\n\nGemma 3 is a well-performing open-weight LLM that, in my opinion, is a bit underappreciated in the open-source circles. The most interesting part is the use of sliding window attention to improve efficiency (it will be interesting to combine it with MoE in the future).\n\nAlso, Gemma 3 has a unique normalization layer placement, placing RMSNorm layers both before and after the attention and FeedForward modules.\n\n**3.4 Bonus: Gemma 3n**\n-----------------------\n\nA few months after the Gemma 3 release, Google shared [Gemma 3n](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n/), which is a Gemma 3 model that has been optimized for small-device efficiency with the goal of running on phones.\n\nOne of the changes in Gemma 3n to achieve better efficiency is the so-called Per-Layer Embedding (PLE) parameters layer. The key idea here is to keep only a subset of the model\'s parameters in GPU memory. Token-layer specific embeddings, such as those for text, audio, and vision modalities, are then streamed from the CPU or SSD on demand.\n\nThe figure below illustrates the PLE memory savings, listing 5.44 billion parameters for a standard Gemma 3 model. This likely refers to the Gemma 3 4-billion variant.\n\n[![Image 24](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Su7d!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb05999d6-88ca-4739-8b0b-266b48da288b_662x483.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Su7d!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb05999d6-88ca-4739-8b0b-266b48da288b_662x483.png)\n\nFigure 15: An annotated figure from Google\'s Gemma 3n blog (https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n/) illustrating the PLE memory savings.\n\nThe 5.44 vs. 4 billion parameter discrepancy is because Google has an interesting way of reporting parameter counts in LLMs. They often exclude embedding parameters to make the model appear smaller, except in cases like this, where it is convenient to include them to make the model appear larger. This is not unique to Google, as this approach has become a common practice across the field.\n\nAnother interesting trick is the[MatFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07707) concept (short for Matryoshka Transformer). For instance, Gemma 3n uses a single shared LLM (transformer) architecture that can be sliced into smaller, independently usable models. Each slice is trained to function on its own, so at inference time, we can run just the part you need (instead of the large model).\n\n4. Mistral Small 3.1\n====================\n\n[Mistral Small 3.1 24B](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3-1), which was released in March shortly after Gemma 3, is noteworthy for outperforming Gemma 3 27B on several benchmarks (except for math) while being faster.\n\nThe reasons for the lower inference latency of Mistral Small 3.1 over Gemma 3 are likely due to their custom tokenizer, as well as shrinking the KV cache and layer count. Otherwise, it\'s a standard architecture as shown in the figure below.\n\n[![Image 25](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZZnO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa861f68d-c50c-471c-bae1-2308c135bb54_1460x793.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZZnO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa861f68d-c50c-471c-bae1-2308c135bb54_1460x793.png)\n\n_Figure 16: An architecture comparison between Gemma 3 27B and Mistral 3.1 Small 24B._\n\nInterestingly, earlier Mistral models had utilized sliding window attention, but they appear to have abandoned it in Mistral Small 3.1. So, since Mistral uses regular Grouped-Query Attention instead of Grouped-Query Attention with a sliding window as in Gemma 3, maybe there are additional inference compute savings due to being able to use more optimized code (i.e., FlashAttention). For instance, I speculate that while sliding window attention reduces memory usage, it doesn\'t necessarily reduce inference latency, which is what Mistral Small 3.1 is focused on.\n\n5. Llama 4\n==========\n\nThe extensive introductory discussion on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) earlier in this article pays off again. [Llama 4](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/) has also adopted an MoE approach and otherwise follows a relatively standard architecture that is very similar to DeepSeek-V3, as shown in the figure below. (Llama 4 includes native multimodal support, similar to models like Gemma and Mistral. However, since this article focuses on language modeling, we only focus on the text model.)\n\n[![Image 26](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ShdO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17518ff9-1f60-4aca-b654-034dabe20626_1600x823.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ShdO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17518ff9-1f60-4aca-b654-034dabe20626_1600x823.png)\n\nFigure 17: An architecture comparison between DeepSeek V3 (671-billion parameters) and Llama 4 Maverick (400-billion parameters).\n\nWhile the Llama 4 Maverick architecture looks very similar to DeepSeek-V3 overall, there are some interesting differences worth highlighting.\n\nFirst, Llama 4 uses Grouped-Query Attention similar to its predecessors, whereas DeepSeek-V3 uses Multi-Head Latent Attention, which we discussed at the beginning of this article. Now, both DeepSeek-V3 and Llama 4 Maverick are very large architectures, with DeepSeek-V3 being approximately 68% larger in its total parameter count. However, with 37 billion active parameters, DeepSeek-V3 has more than twice as many active parameters as Llama 4 Maverick (17B).\n\nLlama 4 Maverick uses a more classic MoE setup with fewer but larger experts (2 active experts with 8,192 hidden size each) compared to DeepSeek-V3 (9 active experts with 2,048 hidden size each). Also, DeepSeek uses MoE layers in each transformer block (except the first 3), whereas Llama 4 alternates MoE and dense modules in every other transformer block.\n\nGiven the many small differences between architectures, it is difficult to determine their exact impact on final model performance. The main takeaway, however, is that MoE architectures have seen a significant rise in popularity in 2025.\n\n6. Qwen3\n========\n\nThe Qwen team consistently delivers high-quality open-weight LLMs. When I helped co-advising the LLM efficiency challenge at NeurIPS 2023, I remember that the top winning solutions were all Qwen2-based.\n\nNow, Qwen3 is another hit model series at the top of the leaderboards for their size classes. There are 7 dense models: 0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B, 14B, and 32B. And there are 2 MoE models: 30B-A3B, and 235B-A22B.\n\n(By the way, note that the missing whitespace in "Qwen3" is not a typo; I simply try to preserve the original spelling the Qwen developers chose.)\n\n**6.1 Qwen3 (Dense)**\n---------------------\n\nLet\'s discuss the dense model architecture first. As of this writing, the 0.6B model may well be the smallest current-generation open-weight model out there. And based on my personal experience, it performs really well given its small size. It has great token/sec throughput and a low memory footprint if you are planning to run it locally. But what\'s more, it\'s also easy to train locally (for educational purposes) due to its small size.\n\nSo, Qwen3 0.6B has replaced Llama 3 1B for me for most purposes. A comparison between these two architectures is shown below.\n\n[![Image 27](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e8cD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5185aaf2-0130-42c3-8705-2b58c17e6c66_1331x807.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e8cD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5185aaf2-0130-42c3-8705-2b58c17e6c66_1331x807.png)\n\nFigure 18: An architecture comparison between Qwen3 0.6B and Llama 3 1B; notice that Qwen3 is a deeper architecture with more layers, whereas Llama 3 is a wider architecture with more attention heads.\n\nIf you are interested in a human-readable Qwen3 implementation without external third-party LLM library dependencies, I recently implemented [Qwen3 from scratch (in pure PyTorch)](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch05/11_qwen3).\n\nThe computational performance numbers in the figure above are based on my from-scratch PyTorch implementations when run on an A100 GPU. As one can see, Qwen3 has a smaller memory footprint as it is a smaller architecture overall, but also uses smaller hidden layers and fewer attention heads. However, it uses more transformer blocks than Llama 3, which leads to a slower runtime (lower tokens/sec generation speed).\n\n**6.2 Qwen3 (MoE)**\n-------------------\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Qwen3 also comes in two MoE flavors: 30B-A3B and 235B-A22B. Why do some architectures, like Qwen3, come as regular (dense) and MoE (sparse) variants?\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this article, MoE variants help reduce inference costs for large base models. Offering both dense and MoE versions gives users flexibility depending on their goals and constraints.\n\nDense models are typically more straightforward to fine-tune, deploy, and optimize across various hardware.\n\nOn the other hand, MoE models are optimized for scaling inference. For instance, at a fixed inference budget, they can achieve a higher overall model capacity (i.e., knowledge uptake during training due to being larger) without proportionally increasing inference costs.\n\nBy releasing both types, the Qwen3 series can support a broader range of use cases: dense models for robustness, simplicity, and fine-tuning, and MoE models for efficient serving at scale.\n\nTo round up this section, let\'s look at Qwen3 235B-A22B (note that the A22B stands for "22B active parameters) to DeepSeek-V3, which has almost twice as many active parameters (37B).\n\n[![Image 28](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cVH6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F102089a8-f0b5-4c1d-aeda-752ccb015d4b_1467x750.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cVH6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F102089a8-f0b5-4c1d-aeda-752ccb015d4b_1467x750.png)\n\nFigure 19: An architecture comparison between DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 235B-A22B.\n\nAs shown in the figure above, the DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 235B-A22B architectures are remarkably similar. What\'s noteworthy, though, is that the Qwen3 model moved away from using a shared expert (earlier Qwen models, such as [Qwen2.5-MoE](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/) did use a shared expert).\n\nUnfortunately, the Qwen3 team did not disclose any reason as to why they moved away from shared experts. If I had to guess, it was perhaps simply not necessary for training stability for their setup when they increased the experts from 2 (in Qwen2.5-MoE) to 8 (in Qwen3). And then they were able to save the extra compute/memory cost by using only 8 instead of 8+1 experts. (However, this doesn\'t explain why DeepSeek-V3 is still keeping their shared expert.)\n\n7. SmolLM3\n==========\n\n[SmolLM3](https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm3) is perhaps not as nearly as popular as the other LLMs covered in this article, but I thought it is still an interesting model to include as it offers really good modeling performance at a relatively small and convenient 3-billion parameter model size that sits between the 1.7B and 4B Qwen3 model, as shown in the figure below.\n\nMoreover, it also shared a lot of the training details, similar to OLMo, which is rare and always appreciated!\n\n[![Image 29](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vPTQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Febfdfd6e-6aee-4894-8a57-307a25bc2c0a_743x519.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vPTQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Febfdfd6e-6aee-4894-8a57-307a25bc2c0a_743x519.png)\n\n_Figure 20: An annotated figure from the SmolLM3 announcement post, https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm3, comparing the SmolLM3 win rate to Qwen3 1.7B and 4B as well as Llama 3 3B and Gemma 3 4B._\n\nAs shown in the architecture comparison figure below, the SmolLM3 architecture looks fairly standard. The perhaps most interesting aspect is its use of NoPE (No Positional Embeddings), though.\n\n[![Image 30](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Iki!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed76de6d-bc7a-4e75-8fc5-9efa626d8d92_1431x777.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Iki!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed76de6d-bc7a-4e75-8fc5-9efa626d8d92_1431x777.png)\n\nFigure 21: A side-by-side architecture comparison between Qwen3 4B and SmolLM3 3B.\n\n**7.1 No Positional Embeddings (NoPE)**\n---------------------------------------\n\nNoPE is, in LLM contexts, an older idea that goes back to a 2023 paper ([The Impact of Positional Encoding on Length Generalization in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19466)) to remove explicit positional information injection (like through classic absolute positional embedding layers in early GPT architectures or nowadays RoPE).\n\nIn transformer-based LLMs, positional encoding is typically necessary because self-attention treats tokens independently of order. Absolute position embeddings solve this by adding an additional embedding layer that adds information to the token embeddings.\n\n[![Image 31](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lLgK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd79f412c-269f-4236-9cbe-81f1a5944ae1_1190x548.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lLgK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd79f412c-269f-4236-9cbe-81f1a5944ae1_1190x548.png)\n\nFigure 22: A modified figure from my Build A Large Language Model (From Scratch) book (https://www.amazon.com/Build-Large-Language-Model-Scratch/dp/1633437167) illustrating absolute positional embeddings.\n\nRoPE, on the other hand, solves this by rotating the query and key vectors relative to their token position.\n\nIn NoPE layers, however, no such positional signal is added at all: not fixed, not learned, not relative. Nothing.\n\nEven though there is no positional embedding, the model still knows which tokens come before, thanks to the causal attention mask. This mask prevents each token from attending to future ones. As a result, a token at position _t_ can only see tokens at positions _≤ t_, which preserves the autoregressive ordering.\n\nSo while there is no positional information that is explicitly added, there is still an implicit sense of direction baked into the model\'s structure, and the LLM, in the regular gradient-descent-based training, can learn to exploit it if it finds it beneficial for the optimization objective. (Check out the NoPE paper\'s theorems for more information.)\n\nSo, overall, the [NoPE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19466) not only found that no positional information injection is necessary, but it also found that NoPE has better length generalization, which means that LLM answering performance deteriorates less with increased sequence length, as shown in the figure below.\n\n[![Image 32](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I9j6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7a57872-2af0-465b-ab5f-2caecc0aac8f_1364x800.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I9j6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7a57872-2af0-465b-ab5f-2caecc0aac8f_1364x800.png)\n\nFigure 23: An annotated figure from the NoPE paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19466) showing better length generalization with NoPE.\n\nNote that the experiments shown above were conducted with a relatively small GPT-style model of approximately 100 million parameters and relatively small context sizes. It is unclear how well these findings generalize to larger, contemporary LLMs.\n\nFor this reason, the SmolLM3 team likely only "applied" NoPE (or rather omitted RoPE) in every 4th layer.\n\n8. Kimi 2\n=========\n\n[Kimi 2](https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/) recently made big waves in the AI community due to being an open-weight model with an incredibly good performance. According to benchmarks, it\'s on par with the best proprietary models like Google\'s Gemini, Anthropic\'s Claude, and OpenAI\'s ChatGPT models.\n\nA notable aspect is its use of a variant of the relatively new[Muon](https://github.com/KellerJordan/Muon) optimizer over AdamW. As far as I know, this is the first time Muon was used over AdamW for any production model of this size ([previously](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16982), it has only been shown to scale up to 16B). This resulted in very nice training loss curves, which probably helped catapult this model to the top of the aforementioned benchmarks.\n\nWhile people commented that the loss was exceptionally smooth (due to the lack of spikes), I think it\'s not exceptionally smooth (e.g., see the OLMo 2 loss curve in the figure below; also, the L2 norm of the gradient would probably be a better metric to track training stability). However, what\'s remarkable is how well the loss curve decays.\n\nHowever, as mentioned in the introduction of this article, training methodologies are a topic for another time.\n\n[![Image 33](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Zh8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78d5d4e4-7dc4-49ab-87be-a885ba78447e_759x684.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Zh8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78d5d4e4-7dc4-49ab-87be-a885ba78447e_759x684.png)\n\nThe model itself is 1 trillion parameters large, which is truly impressive.\n\nIt may be the biggest LLM of this generation as of this writing (given the constraints that Llama 4 Behemoth is not released, proprietary LLMs don\'t count, and Google\'s 1.6 trillion [Switch Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961) is an encoder-decoder architecture from a different generation).\n\nIt\'s also coming full circle as Kimi 2 uses the DeepSeek-V3 architecture we covered at the beginning of this article except they made it larger, as shown in the figure below.\n\n[![Image 34](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3em!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb721c5ef-057b-405b-9293-f11e161d9230_1599x816.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B3em!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb721c5ef-057b-405b-9293-f11e161d9230_1599x816.png)\n\nFigure 25: An architecture comparison between DeepSeek V3 and Kimi K2.\n\nAs shown in the figure above, Kimi 2.5 is basically the same as DeepSeek V3, except that it uses more experts in the MoE modules and fewer heads in the Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) module.\n\nKimi 2 is not coming out of nowhere. The earlier Kimi 1.5 model discussed in the [Kimi k1.5: Scaling Reinforcement Learning with LLMs paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12599), was impressive as well. However, it had the bad luck that the DeepSeek R1 model paper was published on exactly the same date on January 22nd. Moreover, as far as I know, the Kimi 1.5 weights were never publicly shared.\n\nSo, most likely the Kimi K2 team took these lessons to heart and shared Kimi K2 as an open-weight model, before DeepSeek R2 was released. As of this writing, Kimi K2 is the most impressive open-weight model.\n\n**After all these years, LLM releases remain exciting, and I am curious to see what\'s next!**\n\n* * *\n\n_This magazine is a personal passion project, and your support helps keep it alive.

It also ended with a raft of spectacular announcements. In this blog post, we review the most significant **technological trends of the past year** and discuss how practitioners can take advantage of them. In particular, we discuss:\n\n![→ Get the Trends Report: 5 GenAI Trends for 2025](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/2123903/064f22f6-a3e1-402b-999d-3b5c1b3f9def.png)\n\n## Competition Intensifies Among LLM Providers\n\nOpenAI's leadership faced stiff competition with GPT-4 by the end of 2024. GPT-4o is today tied with o1 — another OpenAI model — and two versions of Google’s Gemini model for the first place of the [LMSYS Chatbot Arena leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/). OpenAI’s rivals, either established companies like Google, Anthropic and Meta, or newcomers, such as 01.ai, X.ai, and DeepSeek founded in 2023, make available powerful models which surpass the version of GPT-4 available in early 2024. This includes models whose weights are open, i.e., that can be downloaded and hosted locally, rather than accessed exclusively through an API.\n\n![year of progress for frontier models](https://blog.dataiku.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image1-Mar-14-2025-04-21-10-0829-PM.png?width=909&height=619&name=image1-Mar-14-2025-04-21-10-0829-PM.png)\n\n![year of progress for frontier models](https://blog.dataiku.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image1-Mar-14-2025-04-21-10-0829-PM.png?width=909&height=619&name=image1-Mar-14-2025-04-21-10-0829-PM.png)\n\n*Figure 1: A year of progress for frontier models. The Chatbot Arena score is a relative ranking system (similar to chess ratings) that measures how well different AI chatbots perform against each other based on crowdsourced human preferences in head-to-head comparisons. Source:* [*Chatbot Arena*](https://lmarena.ai/)\n\nIn parallel to this **race to the most capable models**, the features offered to developers by LLM providers tend to converge. Common features now include:\n\n## Small Yet Powerful Models Become Available\n\nUntil recently, the most effective recipe to train a better LLM was to increase the number of parameters as well as the size of the training corpus. This proved true with GPT-1 (117 million parameters trained on 4.5 GB of text), GPT-2 (1.5 billion parameters trained on 40 GB), GPT-3 (175 billion parameters trained on 570 GB), and GPT-4 (even though its architecture and training data were not disclosed).\n\nHowever, pre-training offers diminishing returns and [organizations are massively investing in LLMs](/surprising-stats-about-the-state-of-ai-today), so **cost efficiency** has become a significant concern and LLM providers now make significant efforts to **reduce the size of models, diminish their memory footprint, and accelerate the text generation process**. To achieve this, they often use a combination of knowledge distillation, model compression techniques (e.g., [quantization](/quantization-in-llms-why-does-it-matter) or pruning) and efficient decoding methods (e.g., speculative decoding).\n\nFor example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic now all offer **LLMs of various sizes** to let developers choose the **right compromise between quality on one hand and speed and costs on the other hand** and, remarkably, some new iterations of fast models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) are more performant than the flagship models of the previous generation (GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3 Opus). Several LLM providers have pushed this logic even further and created a series **of small models** (e.g., Phi 3, SmolLM, or Gemma) with a number of parameters ranging from one hundred million to a few billions. It is now possible to run lightweight models on **local devices such as smartphones and laptops**, when low latency or privacy are critical.\n\n## LLMs Now Have Eyes and Ears\n\nThe first LLMs able to process non-textual information appeared in 2022 and the first commercial offerings with such capabilities were made available at the end of 2023, but it was truly in 2024 that [**multimodal LLMs**](https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/demystifying-multimodal-llm-053143c07d6f) became mainstream. Now, all major LLM providers include the possibility to process **images** and sometimes **audio** and **videos** alongside texts.\n\nThis opens up the possibility of effectively [processing rich sources of information](https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/beyond-text-taking-advantage-of-rich-information-sources-with-multimodal-rag-0f98ff077308) such as **documents including not only text but also pictures, charts, and tables**. Eighteen months ago, it would have been possible but challenging, time-consuming, and error-prone to implement a question-answering system based on these documents. In contrast, this is quite straightforward today, thanks to multimodal LLMs as well as recent multimodal retrieval models like [ColPali](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01449) or modern document parsing libraries or APIs. Multimodal LLMs also enable **more natural and more reactive user interfaces**, in particular by taking advantage of **real-time sensors** like the camera feed or the microphone of a smartphone.\n\n## Is This the End of the Pre-Training Era?\n\nThe era of scaling models purely through size is waning. As increasing the volume of pre-training computations and data becomes [less and less efficient](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-rivals-seek-new-path-smarter-ai-current-methods-hit-limitations-2024-11-11/), LLM providers consider alternative routes to develop the next generation of models.\n\nIn September 2024, OpenAI unveiled [o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), a series of experimental models that were specifically fine-tuned to generate chains of thoughts before providing an answer. These models scored particularly high in math, coding, and science benchmarks. Interestingly, the performance of o1 increases with both **train-time compute** (i.e., the computations required to fine-tune the model) and **test-time compute** (i.e., the computations needed to generate answers and the associated chains of thoughts once the model has been finetuned).\n\nThis offers the possibility of a [compute-optimal scaling strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314) that puts a **higher emphasis on the text generation step** and yields better results for reasoning tasks but potentially increases the cost and latency per response. Several OpenAI competitors work on a similar approach and Google and DeepSeek have already unveiled their [reasoning models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/thinking-mode) while OpenAI offered a glimpse of [o3](https://openai.com/12-days/?day=12) — o1’s successor with impressive capabilities — in December 2024.\n\n![Score achieved by GPT-4o, o1-preview, and o3 on the ARC-AGI-1 dataset](https://blog.dataiku.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image2-Mar-14-2025-04-21-10-0096-PM.png?width=805&height=478&name=image2-Mar-14-2025-04-21-10-0096-PM.png)\n\n![Score achieved by GPT-4o, o1-preview, and o3 on the ARC-AGI-1 dataset](https://blog.dataiku.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image2-Mar-14-2025-04-21-10-0096-PM.png?width=805&height=478&name=image2-Mar-14-2025-04-21-10-0096-PM.png)\n\n*Figure 2: Score achieved by GPT-4o, o1-preview, and o3 on the ARC-AGI-1 dataset, a challenging benchmark measuring generalization on novel logical tasks. Please note that o3 and o1-preview required much more test-time computation than GPT-4o. Source:* [*ARC Prize*](https://arcprize.org/2024-results)\n\nThis mirrors the long-time trend to develop [compound AI systems](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/). These systems compensate for the shortcomings of models by modifying the way these models are queried or augmenting them with **external components**. They can involve relatively simple prompt engineering approaches such as chain-of-thought or retrieval-augmented generation or more sophisticated approaches like LLM agents, [structured text generation techniques](/your-guide-to-structured-text-generation), and optimization frameworks (e.g., [DSPY](https://dspy.ai/)).\n\n## Future-Proof Tactics for LLM Practitioners\n\nOne year ago, it would have been hard to imagine all the recent progress in the field of LLMs. This warrants some caution when trying to anticipate future developments. Nonetheless, given the intensity of the competition among LLM providers and how significant their investments are, **it is safe to bet on significant improvements of LLMs** and prepare to benefit from them. In this context, our recommendations are threefold:\n\n## Get the 5 Must-Know GenAI Trends for 2025\n\n## Subscribe to the Dataiku Blog\n\n## You May Also Like\n\n### [From Reactive to Proactive: How AI Agents Transform Enterprise Decision Cycles](https://blog.dataiku.com/how-ai-agents-transform-enterprise-decision-cycles)\n\n### [Why Every Analyst Needs to Become a Context Engineer to Stay Ahead](https://blog.dataiku.com/every-analyst-needs-to-become-a-context-engineer)\n\n### [From Bedside to Backend: Making Sense of Real-World Health Data](https://blog.dataiku.com/making-sense-of-real-world-health-data)\n\n### [AI Agents: Setting The Bar For Manufacturing Maintenance](https://blog.dataiku.com/ai-agents-setting-the-bar-for-manufacturing-maintenance)\n\n©\xa02013 - 2025 \xa0Dataiku.

Accessed September 10, 2024.") LLMs along with [generative AI](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai/) have an influence on a variety of areas, including medical imaging analysis and high-resolution weather forecasting.\n\nHowever, their effectiveness is hindered by concerns surrounding bias, inaccuracy, and toxicity, which limit their broader adoption and raise ethical concerns.\n\nSee the future of large language models by delving into promising approaches, such as self-training, fact-checking, and sparse expertise that could LLM limitations.\n\n## **Future trends of large language models**\n\n### **1- Fact-checking with real-time data integration**\n\n[LLMs](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-models/) will focus on conducting fact-checks based on real-world implementation by:\n\nThis will allow LLMs to offer up-to-date information rather than relying solely on pre-trained static datasets.\n\n**Real-life example:** Real-time AI assistants **Microsoft Copilot** (formerly called Bing Chat) integrate GPT-4 with live internet data to answer questions based on current events.[2](https://research.aimultiple.com/future-of-large-language-models/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-656552 "“Bing Search now in Chat + when will it be” OpenAI. 2023. Accessed September 10, 2024.")\n\nAlthough it is still early to conclude that accuracy, fact-checking, and static knowledge base problems can be overcome in the near-future models, current research results are promising for the future.\n\nThis may reduce the need for using prompt engineering to cross-check model output since the model will already have cross-checked its results.\n\n### **2- Synthetic training data**\n\nResearchers are working on large language models that can generate their own training data sets (i.e. generating synthetic training data sets).\n\n**Google** researchers developed a large language model capable of creating questions and fine-tuning itself using the curated answers. The model’s performance improved from 74.2% to 82.1% on GSM8K and from 78.2% to 83.0% on DROP.\n\nFigure: Overview of Google’s self-improving model\n\n![](https://research.aimultiple.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GOOGLE.png.webp)\n\n[Source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11610.pdf): “Large Language Models Can Self-Improve”\n\n### **3- Sparse expertise**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) will increasingly leverage **sparse expert models**.\n\nSparse models will allow certain parts of the model to specialize in specific tasks or knowledge. Instead of activating the entire neural network for every input (e.g. only a relevant subset of parameters depending on the task or prompt.)\n\nThis will allow LLM models to make sense of the neural activity within language models by focusing only on the most necessary parts.\n\n![](https://research.aimultiple.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-78-1200x633.png.webp)\n\n**Real-life example:** **OpenAI** is exploring sparse models to make sense of neural networks and improve LLMs’ scaling and specialization.[3](https://research.aimultiple.com/future-of-large-language-models/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-656553 "“Extracting Concepts from GPT-4” OpenAI. 2024. Accessed September 10, 2024.")\n\nFuture iterations may include sparse activation to optimize resource usage, potentially leading to more efficient, task-specific models without the computational intensity of fully dense networks.\n\n### 4- **LLMs integration into enterprise workflows**\n\nLLMs will be deeply integrated into business processes such as customer service, human resources, and decision-making tools.\n\n**Real-life example:** [**Salesforce Einstein** **Copilot**](https://research.aimultiple.com/enterprise-ai-agents/#enterprise-ai-agents-deep-dive) is an enterprise-wide customer service AI that integrates LLMs to enhance service/retail, sales, marketing, and CRM operations, \xa0by answering queries, generating content, and carrying out actions.\n\n### 5- **Hybrid LLMs with multimodal capabilities**\n\nFuture advancements may include [large multimodal models](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-multimodal-models/) that integrate multiple forms of data such as text, images, and audio, allowing these models to understand and generate content across different media types, further enhancing their capabilities and applications.\n\n**Example:** OpenAI’s **DALL·E**, **GPT-4,** or **Google’s Gemini** provide **multimodal capabilities** to process images and text, enabling applications like image captioning or visual question answering.\n\n### 6- Reasoning models\n\nReasoning models represent the next stage in the evolution of large language models. They empower LLMs to move from surface-level fluency to **deep cognitive function** across complex tasks (e.g., scientific research, or strategic decision-making).\n\nThis **shift from prediction to reasoning** is critical for enabling:\n\n**Real-world example:**\n\nDevelopers use **Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet**, a reasoning model, to refactor code.[4](https://research.aimultiple.com/future-of-large-language-models/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-656554 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjos–a5Npw")\n\n### **7- Fine-tuned domain-specific LLMs**\n\nGartner Poll finds that 70% of firms are\xa0investing in generative AI research to incorporate\xa0it into their business strategies.[5](https://research.aimultiple.com/future-of-large-language-models/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-656555 "“Gartner Poll Finds 45% of Executives Say ChatGPT Has Prompted an Increase in AI Investment” Gartner. 2023. Accessed September 10, 2024.")\n\n**Google, Microsoft, and Meta** are developing their own proprietary, customized\xa0models to\xa0provide their customers with a unique and personalized experience.\n\nThese\xa0specialized LLMs can result in fewer hallucinations and higher accuracy by leveraging:\n\nSee LLMs specialized for specific domains such as coding, finance healthcare, and law:\n\n### 8- **Ethical AI and bias mitigation**\n\nCompanies are increasingly focusing on ethical AI and bias mitigation in the development and deployment of large language models (LLMs).\n\n**Real-life examples:**\n\n## **What is the current stage of large language models?**\n\n**Scaling of models**: The newest LLMs, like **GPT-4** (1.8T parameters), **Claude 3** (2T parameters), and **Meta’s LLaMA 3** (405B parameters), are being trained on billions (or trillions) of parameters, further improving capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and reasoning.\n\n**Benchmarks** **– AI is improving:** These models are performing at or near human-level accuracy on reading, image recognition, etc.\n\n![](https://research.aimultiple.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2024-09-07-214037.png.webp)\n\nSource: ContextualAI[13](https://research.aimultiple.com/future-of-large-language-models/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-6565513 "“Plotting Progress in AI” ContextualAI. 2023. Accessed September 8, 2024.")\n\n**Task specialization and fine-tuning**: LLMs are now being fine-tuned for specific domains, such as healthcare (e.g., **Med-PaLM 2**), law, and science. Models like **Radiology-Llama2** and **MedAlpaca** are fine-tuned with domain-specific data, allowing for more accurate and context-relevant outputs in specialized fields.\n\n**Read more:** [Large Language Models in Healthcare](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-models-in-healthcare/).\n\n**Integration beyond text**: LLMs are advancing toward multi-modal capabilities, where they can process not only text but also images, audio, and even video. OpenAI’s **GPT-4** and **Google’s Gemini models** are examples of multi-modal models that can interpret text alongside other media formats.\n\n**Safety mechanisms – adopting ethics:** Leading LLMs are now designed with improved safety protocols to minimize biased outputs. For instance, Anthropic’s Claude models have integrated ethical AI design principles to ensure safer language generation.[14](https://research.aimultiple.com/future-of-large-language-models/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-6565514 "“AI Governance and Accountability: An Analysis of Anthropic’s Claude” arxiv. 2023. Accessed September 8, 2024.")\n\n## Limitations of large language models (LLMs)\n\n### **1- Accuracy**\n\nAccuracy benchmarks often measure LLMs’ ability to perform tasks such as fact-checking or answering questions from structured data. Models like **GPT-4**, and **OpenAI-o1-mini** show improved accuracy.\n\nFigure: Hallucination benchmark for popular LLMs\n\n![](https://research.aimultiple.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hall.png.webp)\n\nSource: ResearchGate[15](https://research.aimultiple.com/future-of-large-language-models/#easy-footnote-bottom-15-6565515 "“Hallucination Leaderboard” GitHub. September 2024. Accessed September 19, 2024.")\n\n### **2- Bias**\n\nLarge language models facilitate human-like communication through speech and text. However, recent findings indicate that more advanced and sizable systems tend to assimilate social [biases](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-bias/) present in their training data, resulting in sexist, racist, or ableist tendencies.\n\nFigure: \xa0Overall bias scores by models and size\n\n![](https://research.aimultiple.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bias.png.webp)\n\nSource: Arxiv[16](https://research.aimultiple.com/future-of-large-language-models/#easy-footnote-bottom-16-6565516 "“Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators” arxiv. 2024. Accessed September 12, 2024.")\n\n### **3- Toxicity**\n\nLLMs may generate toxic, harmful, or offensive content due to inherent biases or failure to identify harmful language.\n\nFigure: LLMs’ toxicity map\n\n![](https://research.aimultiple.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/toxicity.png.webp)\n\nSource: UCLA, UC Berkeley Researchers[17](https://research.aimultiple.com/future-of-large-language-models/#easy-footnote-bottom-17-6565517 "“OR-Bench: An Over-Refusal Benchmark for Large Language Models” arxiv. October 2023. Accessed September 12, 2024.")\n\n*\\*GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09\\*, Llama-3-70b\\*, and Gemini-1.5-pro\\* are used as the moderator, thus the results could be biased on these 3 models*.\n\n### **4- Capacity limitations**\n\nEvery large language model has a specific memory capacity, which restricts the number of tokens it can process as input. For example, ChatGPT has a 2048-token limit (approximately 1500 words), preventing it from comprehending and producing outputs for inputs that surpass this token threshold.\n\nGPT-4 extended the capacity to 25,000 words, far exceeding the ChatGPT model depending on GPT-3.5, allowing room for better performance.\n\nFigure: Word limit comparison between ChatGPT and GPT-4\n\n![](https://research.aimultiple.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Word-limit-comparison-between-ChatGPT-and-GPT-4-1200x1160.png.webp)\n\nSource: OpenAI\n\n### **5- Pre-trained knowledge set**\n\nLLMs like GPT-4 rely on **pre-trained knowledge sets**, meaning they are trained on large-scale datasets and retain information from that period up until a specific point (the “knowledge cutoff”).\n\nThis creates limitations because they do not have access to real-time data or updates unless fine-tuned later or connected to external sources.\n\nThis leads to several problems such as:\n\n## **What are the popular large language models?**\n\n### **Gemini (Google)**\n\nGemini is Google’s, launched in 2023,\xa0is\xa0created by Google’s AI research teams DeepMind and Google Research.

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ['## Benchmarking Fundamentals\n\nBenchmarking is a critical and multidimensional process at the heart of evaluating large language models (LLMs). It provides essential structure for model comparison, progress tracking, and validation against both technical and application-driven requirements. In the rapidly evolving field of generative AI, benchmarking practices have adapted to meet new challenges around scale, complexity, deployment contexts, and ethical considerations. This section provides a comprehensive analysis of benchmarking principles, the spectrum of benchmarks applied to LLMs, and the criteria that define effective benchmarking in contemporary AI research and practice.\n\n### The Role and Necessity of Benchmarking in LLM Evaluation\n\nBenchmarking constitutes the systematic measurement of LLM performance using controlled and repeatable protocols. By grounding evaluations in clearly defined datasets, tasks, and performance metrics, benchmarking enables an objective and transparent assessment of disparate models, architectures, and training strategies. This objectivity is a safeguard against subjective or anecdotal claims regarding the quality and capabilities of LLMs.\n\nKey roles of benchmarking in LLM development include:\n\n- **Objective Evaluation:** Standardized benchmarks minimize interpretive bias and help ensure that model performance claims are defensible and comparable. This objectivity underpins scientific advancement and fosters trust among stakeholders.\n- **Comparative Analysis:** With the proliferation of architectures and training paradigms, direct comparisons enabled by benchmarking are vital for surfacing the strengths and weaknesses of different models, facilitating informed selection for deployment or further research.\n- **Progress Tracking:** The evolution of LLM capabilities can only be charted using benchmarks that are both stable (enabling year-over-year tracking) and adaptable to new tasks, contexts, or risks.\n- **Deployment Guidance:** Benchmarks provide practitioners with practical insights into how models perform in representative tasks and under relevant constraints, informing safe and effective integration into real-world applications across diverse domains.\n\nThe necessity of rigorous benchmarking arises the pace of technical innovation in LLMs, the diversity and criticality of deployment settings (e.g., legal, medical, creative industries), and the mounting demand for trustworthiness, fairness, and robustness in AI.\n\n### Types of Benchmarks Used for LLMs\n\nThe landscape of LLM benchmarking is heterogeneous, shaped by the variety of tasks, performance aspects, and risk factors relevant to model assessment. Benchmark types can be delineated into three primary categories—task-based, technical, and hybrid/composite—each illuminating distinct dimensions of LLM performance.\n\n#### Task-Based Benchmarks\n\nTask-based benchmarks evaluate the end-to-end ability of LLMs to perform well-defined user or expert tasks, typically inspired by real-world applications or standardized human assessments.\n\n**Representative Categories and Examples:**\n- **Exam-style/Multiple-choice (MCQ):** Frameworks such as MMLU, GLUE, SuperGLUE, and AGIEval assess LLM understanding and reasoning across a diverse set of subjects and question styles.\n- **Domain-Specific Tasks:** Specialized benchmarks target contextual abilities, e.g., HumanEval for programming, MultiMedQA for medical reasoning, LegalBench for legal tasks, FLUE for finance, and C-Eval or GPQA for subject-specific question answering.\n- **Conversational and Summarization Tasks:** MultiTurn dialog benchmarks, SQuAD (for reading comprehension), TruthfulQA (for truthful information generation), and FEVER (for fact verification) probe nuanced aspects of language interaction and content retrieval.\n\n**Strengths and Limitations:**\nTask-based benchmarks align closely with practical deployment, facilitating comparisons with human baselines. However, their static nature can promote benchmark-specific optimization (“gaming”) without ensuring broader generalization. Additionally, narrow task scopes may miss emergent reasoning, problem-solving, or adaptation capabilities that appear in novel applications.\n\n#### Technical/Infrastructure-Centric Benchmarks\n\nTechnical benchmarks focus on the computational, architectural, and system-level characteristics of deploying LLMs.\n\n**Dimensions and Examples:**\n- **Inference and Training Efficiency:** Measures such as FLOPS, response latency, memory usage, and power consumption, as in MLPerf or DeepBench, help in evaluating deployments at scale, cost, and resource-efficiency.\n- **Scalability and Robustness:** Assessment under distributed computing, fault conditions, or varying workloads—vital for cloud, edge, or industrial adoption.\n- **Hardware Utilization and Throughput:** Metrics here reflect practical concerns like deployment feasibility and cost-effectiveness.\n\n**Strengths and Limitations:**\nThese benchmarks are essential for operationalizing LLMs in resource-constrained or high-throughput environments but do not reflect semantic or task-based model competency as perceived by end users.\n\n#### Hybrid and Composite Benchmarks\n\nHybrid benchmarks integrate both task and technical evaluations to capture fuller dimensions of LLM deployment.\n\n**Key Benchmarks and Applications:**\n- **Agent and Tool Use:** Tasks like those in ToolBench, AgentBench, and APIBank test LLMs’ ability to interact with software tools or APIs, emphasizing both reasoning correctness and computational/resource constraints.\n- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Multimodal Evaluation:** Benchmarks such as Needle-in-a-Haystack, RAGTruth, MMNeedle, and BeIR track the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval, context integration, and code or multimodal processing.\n- **Adversarial and Safety Testing:** Red-teaming, stress testing, and toxicity evaluation (e.g., via TruthfulQA or purpose-built safety/adversarial challenges) probe the resilience of LLMs to manipulation, hallucination, and content-specific threats.\n\n**Strengths and Limitations:**\nHybrid benchmarks furnish a realistic sense of performance in complex, end-to-end use cases, which is increasingly important given the emergence of LLM agents and tool-augmented systems. However, their complexity makes standardization and interpretability more challenging.\n\n### Technical Dimensions and Emerging Trends in Benchmarks\n\nBenchmarks may also be classified by critical technical and methodological attributes:\n\n- **Static vs. Dynamic Assessment:** Most benchmarks are static, but scenario-based “behavioral profiling” and dynamically updated tests are gaining traction to capture adaptive behavior and contextual interaction (e.g., multi-turn dialogues, tool-calling).\n- **Evaluation Granularity:** From single-turn QA to prolonged conversational coherence or scenario-based reasoning, benchmarks now vary in the depth and sequence of required interactions.\n- **Language and Domain Diversity:** Traditional benchmarks have been predominantly English-centric; there is growing recognition of the need for multilingual, multicultural, and cross-domain evaluations.\n- **Human vs. Automated Scoring:** While traditional metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, exact match) offer scalability, subjective aspects such as helpfulness, harmlessness, and preference rankings increasingly require robust, protocol-driven human evaluation for nuanced assessments.\n\n### Criteria for Effective Benchmarking: Reliability, Relevance, and Comprehensiveness\n\nRobust LLM benchmarking must adhere to foundational criteria to ensure the validity and utility of results for research, development, and deployment.\n\n#### Reliability\n\nReliability implies that benchmark results are stable, reproducible, and minimally sensitive to superficial factors:\n\n- **Standardization and Transparency:** Open-source protocols, clear documentation, and reproducible evaluation scripts minimize discrepancies across implementations.\n- **Statistical Rigor:** Use of confidence intervals, significance testing, and systematic evaluation of prompt sensitivity is essential to guard against spurious or non-generalizable findings.\n- **Robustness to Gaming and Bias:** Benchmarks should be constructed and maintained to resist “teaching to the test,” data leakage, or inadvertent cultural/linguistic biases.\n\n#### Relevance\n\nRelevance ensures alignment with real-world application needs and stakeholder priorities:\n\n- **Task and Domain Suitability:** Benchmarks should track the evolution of LLM use cases, spanning everything from customer support and medical advice to legal or technical content generation and retrieval.\n- **Stakeholder Inclusion:** Evaluation criteria and task choices should reflect the needs not only of developers and researchers, but also of end users, regulatory bodies, and affected communities.\n\n#### Comprehensiveness\n\nComprehensiveness requires that benchmarks capture the full breadth of capabilities and limitations of LLMs:\n\n- **Coverage of Linguistic, Reasoning, and Robustness Dimensions:** Effective evaluation must probe syntax, semantics, pragmatics, world knowledge, reasoning (deductive, inductive, abductive), and generalization under adversarial or out-of-distribution scenarios.\n- **Diversity in Inputs and Outputs:** From multilingual support to multimodal (text, image, code, tables) inputs and outputs, benchmarks should challenge the range of expected deployments.\n- **Inclusion of Edge Cases and Failure Modes:** Probing for hallucinations, ambiguous queries, and multi-step reasoning failures ensures that models are assessed beyond the “happy path.”\n\n#### Additional Criteria: Scalability, Evolvability, and Ethical Considerations\n\n- **Scalability and Automation:** Benchmarks should be supported by tools and frameworks enabling automated, large-scale evaluation (e.g., EleutherAI LM Evaluation Harness, OpenAI Evals), with extensible interfaces for new models and tasks.\n- **Evolving and Community-Driven:** To remain relevant amid rapid LLM evolution, benchmarks should support periodic updates, audits, and openness for community contributions, allowing adaptation to new risk factors and capabilities.\n- **Ethical and Societal Impact:** Safety, inclusivity, and sensitivity to cultural, societal, and domain-specific norms are fundamental. This includes the explicit assessment of model propensity for harmful content, bias, or misinformation, and attention to fair representation of linguistic and cultural diversity.\n\n### Notable Tools, Benchmarks, and Frameworks\n\n- **Evaluation Suites:** MMLU, GLUE, SuperGLUE, HumanEval, MultiMedQA, LegalBench, TOOLBench, AgentBench, MMNeedle, RAGTruth\n- **Automation Platforms:** EleutherAI LM Evaluation Harness, HELM, AlpacaEval, H2O LLM EvalGPT, OpenAI Evals\n- **Technical/System Benchmarks:** MLPerf, DeepBench, AI-Bench, BOLAA\n- **Ethics and Safety Assessments:** TruthfulQA, red-teaming protocols\n\n### Core Challenges and Ongoing Debates\n\nPersisting challenges in LLM benchmarking include reliance on static or English-centric datasets, evolving prompt engineering paradigms, the risk of overfitting or benchmark gaming, limited coverage of multimodal and tool-augmented settings, and subjectivity or bias in human-in-the-loop evaluation. The community continues to debate the balance between standardized, repeatable evaluation and the need for dynamic, context-aware, and culturally inclusive benchmarks that truly reflect both the opportunity and risks inherent in LLM deployment.\n\nThrough continuous refinement and broadening of benchmarking frameworks—anchored in reliability, relevance, and comprehensiveness—the AI field strives not only to accelerate model innovation but also to promote responsible, equitable, and effective language model adoption across all domains.'], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='benchmarking fundamentals in machine learning model evaluation'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html', title='12 Benchmarking AI', raw_content='12 Benchmarking AI – Machine Learning Systems\n\n===============\n\n[Machine Learning Systems](https://mlsysbook.ai/)\n\n[](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book "Source Code")[](https://mlsysbook.ai/Machine-Learning-Systems.pdf "Download PDF")\n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html "Share")\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=%7Curl%7C)\n*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%7Curl%7C)\n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html "Toggle dark mode")[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html "Toggle reader mode")\n\n1.

Banners with ‘AI Olympics’ are displayed prominently in the background._\n\nPurpose[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#purpose)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_How can quantitative evaluation reshape the development of machine learning systems, and what metrics reveal true system capabilities?_\n\nThe measurement and analysis of AI system performance represent a critical element in bridging theoretical capabilities with practical outcomes. Systematic evaluation approaches reveal fundamental relationships between model behavior, resource utilization, and operational reliability. These measurements draw out the essential trade-offs across accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, providing insights that guide architectural decisions throughout the development lifecycle. These evaluation frameworks establish core principles for assessing and validating system design choices and enable the creation of robust solutions that meet increasingly complex performance requirements across diverse deployment scenarios.\n\n Learning Objectives \n\n*   Understand the objectives of AI benchmarking, including performance evaluation, resource assessment, and validation.\n\n*   Differentiate between training and inference benchmarking and their respective evaluation methodologies.\n\n*   Identify key benchmarking metrics and trends, including accuracy, fairness, complexity, and efficiency.\n\n*   Recognize system benchmarking concepts, including throughput, latency, power consumption, and computational efficiency.\n\n*   Understand the limitations of isolated evaluations and the necessity of integrated benchmarking frameworks.\n\n12.1 Overview[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#overview)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComputing systems continue to evolve and grow in complexity. Understanding their performance becomes essential to engineer them better. System evaluation measures how computing systems perform relative to specified requirements and goals. Engineers and researchers examine metrics like processing speed, resource usage, and reliability to understand system behavior under different conditions and workloads. These measurements help teams identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and verify that systems meet design specifications.\n\nStandardized measurement forms the backbone of scientific and engineering progress. The metric system enables precise communication of physical quantities. Organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology maintain fundamental measures from the kilogram to the second. This standardization extends to computing, where benchmarks provide uniform methods to quantify system performance. Standard performance tests measure processor operations, memory bandwidth, network throughput, and other computing capabilities. These benchmarks allow meaningful comparison between different hardware and software configurations.\n\nMachine learning systems present distinct measurement challenges. Unlike traditional computing tasks, ML systems integrate hardware performance, algorithmic behavior, and data characteristics. Performance evaluation must account for computational efficiency and statistical effectiveness. Training time, model accuracy, and generalization capabilities all factor into system assessment. The interdependence between computing resources, algorithmic choices, and dataset properties creates new dimensions for measurement and comparison.\n\nThese considerations lead us to define machine learning benchmarking as follows:\n\n Definition of ML Benchmarking \n\n**Machine Learning Benchmarking (ML Benchmarking)** is the _systematic evaluation_ of _compute performance, algorithmic effectiveness, and data quality_ in machine learning systems. It assesses _system capabilities_, _model accuracy and convergence_, and _data scalability and representativeness_ to optimize system performance across diverse workloads. ML benchmarking enables engineers and researchers to _quantify trade-offs_, _improve deployment efficiency_, and _ensure reproducibility_ in both research and production settings. As ML systems evolve, benchmarks also incorporate _fairness, robustness, and energy efficiency_, reflecting the increasing complexity of AI evaluation.\n\nThis chapter focuses primarily on benchmarking machine learning systems, examining how computational resources affect training and inference performance. While the main emphasis remains on system-level evaluation, understanding the role of algorithms and data proves essential for comprehensive ML benchmarking.\n\n12.2 Historical Context[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#historical-context)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe evolution of computing benchmarks mirrors the development of computer systems themselves, progressing from simple performance metrics to increasingly specialized evaluation frameworks. As computing expanded beyond scientific calculations into diverse applications, benchmarks evolved to measure new capabilities, constraints, and use cases. This progression reflects three major shifts in computing: the transition from mainframes to personal computers, the rise of energy efficiency as a critical concern, and the emergence of specialized computing domains such as machine learning.\n\nEarly benchmarks focused primarily on raw computational power, measuring basic operations like floating-point calculations. As computing applications diversified, benchmark development branched into distinct specialized categories, each designed to evaluate specific aspects of system performance. This specialization accelerated with the emergence of graphics processing, mobile computing, and eventually, cloud services and machine learning.\n\n### 12.2.1 Performance Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#performance-benchmarks)\n\nThe evolution of benchmarks in computing illustrates how systematic performance measurement has shaped technological progress. During the 1960s and 1970s, when mainframe computers dominated the computing landscape, performance benchmarks focused primarily on fundamental computational tasks. The [Whetstone benchmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whetstone_(benchmark)), introduced in 1964 to measure floating-point arithmetic performance, became a definitive standard that demonstrated how systematic testing could drive improvements in computer architecture ([Curnow 1976](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-curnow1976synthetic)).\n\n Curnow, H. J. 1976. “A Synthetic Benchmark.”_The Computer Journal_ 19 (1): 43–49. [https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/19.1.43](https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/19.1.43). \n\n Weicker, Reinhold P. 1984. “Dhrystone: A Synthetic Systems Programming Benchmark.”_Communications of the ACM_ 27 (10): 1013–30. [https://doi.org/10.1145/358274.358283](https://doi.org/10.1145/358274.358283). \n\nThe introduction of the [LINPACK benchmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmark) in 1979 expanded the focus of performance evaluation, offering a means to assess how efficiently systems solved linear equations. As computing shifted toward personal computers in the 1980s, the need for standardized performance measurement grew. The [Dhrystone benchmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone), introduced in 1984, provided one of the first integer-based benchmarks, complementing floating-point evaluations ([Weicker 1984](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-Weicker1984)).\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s saw the emergence of systematic benchmarking frameworks that emphasized real-world workloads. The [SPEC CPU benchmarks](https://www.spec.org/cpu/), introduced in 1989 by the [System Performance Evaluation Cooperative (SPEC)](https://www.spec.org/), fundamentally changed hardware evaluation by shifting the focus from synthetic tests to a standardized suite designed to measure performance using practical computing workloads. This approach enabled manufacturers to optimize their systems for real applications, accelerating advances in processor design and software optimization.\n\nThe increasing demand for graphics-intensive applications and mobile computing in the 1990s and early 2000s presented new benchmarking challenges. The introduction of [3DMark](https://www.3dmark.com/) in 1998 established an industry standard for evaluating graphics performance, shaping the development of programmable shaders and modern GPU architectures. Mobile computing introduced an additional constraint, namely, power efficiency, necessitating benchmarks that assessed both computational performance and energy consumption. The release of [MobileMark](https://bapco.com/products/mobilemark-2014/) by [BAPCo](https://bapco.com/) provided a means to evaluate power efficiency in laptops and mobile devices, influencing the development of energy-efficient architectures such as [ARM](https://www.arm.com/).\n\nThe focus of benchmarking in the past decade has shifted toward cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence. Cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud optimize their platforms based on performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness ([Ranganathan and Hölzle 2024](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-ranganathan2024twenty)). Benchmarks like [CloudSuite](http://cloudsuite.ch/) have become critical for evaluating cloud infrastructure, measuring how well systems handle distributed workloads. Machine learning has introduced another dimension of performance evaluation. The introduction of [MLPerf](https://mlcommons.org/) in 2018 established a widely accepted standard for measuring machine learning training and inference efficiency across different hardware architectures.\n\n Ranganathan, Parthasarathy, and Urs Hölzle. 2024. “Twenty Five Years of Warehouse-Scale Computing.”_IEEE Micro_ 44 (5): 11–22. [https://doi.org/10.1109/mm.2024.3409469](https://doi.org/10.1109/mm.2024.3409469). \n\n### 12.2.2 Energy Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#energy-benchmarks)\n\nAs computing scaled from personal devices to massive data centers, energy efficiency emerged as a critical dimension of performance evaluation. The mid-2000s marked a shift in benchmarking methodologies, moving beyond raw computational speed to assess power efficiency across diverse computing platforms. The increasing thermal constraints in processor design, coupled with the scaling demands of large-scale internet services, underscored energy consumption as a fundamental consideration in system evaluation ([Barroso and Hölzle 2007](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-Barroso2003)).\n\n Barroso, Luiz André, and Urs Hölzle. 2007. “The Case for Energy-Proportional Computing.”_Computer_ 40 (12): 33–37. [https://doi.org/10.1109/mc.2007.443](https://doi.org/10.1109/mc.2007.443). \n\nPower benchmarking addresses three interconnected challenges: environmental sustainability, operational efficiency, and device usability. The growing energy demands of the technology sector have intensified concerns about sustainability, while energy costs continue to shape the economics of data center operations. In mobile computing, power efficiency directly determines battery life and user experience, reinforcing the importance of energy-aware performance measurement.\n\nThe industry has responded with several standardized benchmarks that quantify energy efficiency. [SPEC Power](https://www.spec.org/power/) provides a widely accepted methodology for measuring server efficiency across varying workload levels, allowing for direct comparisons of power-performance trade-offs. The [Green500](https://top500.org/lists/green500/) ranking applies similar principles to high-performance computing, ranking the world’s most powerful supercomputers based on their energy efficiency rather than their raw performance. The [ENERGY STAR](https://www.energystar.gov/products/computers) certification program has also established foundational energy standards that have shaped the design of consumer and enterprise computing systems.\n\nPower benchmarking faces distinct challenges, particularly in accounting for the diverse workload patterns and system configurations encountered across different computing environments. Recent advancements, such as the [MLPerf Power](https://mlcommons.org/) benchmark, have introduced specialized methodologies for measuring the energy impact of machine learning workloads, addressing the growing importance of energy efficiency in AI-driven computing. As artificial intelligence and edge computing continue to evolve, power benchmarking will play an increasingly crucial role in driving energy-efficient hardware and software innovations.\n\n### 12.2.3 Domain-Specific Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#domain-specific-benchmarks)\n\nThe evolution of computing applications, particularly in artificial intelligence, has highlighted the limitations of general-purpose benchmarks and led to the development of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. Standardized benchmarks, while effective for assessing broad system performance, often fail to capture the unique constraints and operational requirements of specialized workloads. This gap has resulted in the emergence of tailored benchmarking methodologies designed to evaluate performance in specific computing domains ([Hennessy and Patterson 2003](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-Hennessy2003)).\n\n Hennessy, John L, and David A Patterson. 2003. “Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach.”_Morgan Kaufmann_. \n\nMachine learning presents one of the most prominent examples of this transition. Traditional CPU and GPU benchmarks are insufficient for assessing workloads, which involve complex interactions between computation, memory bandwidth, and data movement. The introduction of MLPerf has standardized performance measurement for machine learning models, providing detailed insights into training and inference efficiency.\n\nBeyond AI, domain-specific benchmarks have been adopted across various industries. Healthcare organizations have developed benchmarking frameworks to evaluate machine learning models used in medical diagnostics, ensuring that performance assessments align with real-world patient data. In financial computing, specialized benchmarking methodologies assess transaction latency and fraud detection accuracy, ensuring that high-frequency trading systems meet stringent timing requirements. Autonomous vehicle developers implement evaluation frameworks that test AI models under varying environmental conditions and traffic scenarios, ensuring the reliability of self-driving systems.\n\nThe strength of domain-specific benchmarks lies in their ability to capture workload-specific performance characteristics that general benchmarks may overlook. By tailoring performance evaluation to sector-specific requirements, these benchmarks provide insights that drive targeted optimizations in both hardware and software. As computing continues to expand into new domains, specialized benchmarking will remain a key tool for assessing and improving performance in emerging fields.\n\n12.3 AI Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#ai-benchmarks)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe evolution of benchmarks reaches its apex in machine learning, reflecting a journey that parallels the field’s development towards domain-specific applications. Early machine learning benchmarks focused primarily on algorithmic performance, measuring how well models could perform specific tasks ([Lecun et al. 1998](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-lecun1998gradient)). As machine learning applications scaled and computational demands grew, the focus expanded to include system performance and hardware efficiency ([Jouppi et al. 2017](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-jouppi2017datacenter)). Most recently, the critical role of data quality has emerged as the third essential dimension of evaluation ([Gebru et al. 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-gebru2021datasheets)).\n\n Jouppi, Norman P., Cliff Young, Nishant Patil, David Patterson, Gaurav Agrawal, Raminder Bajwa, Sarah Bates, et al. 2017. “In-Datacenter Performance Analysis of a Tensor Processing Unit.” In _Proceedings of the 44th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture_, 45:1–12. 2. ACM. [https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080246](https://doi.org/10.1145/3079856.3080246). \n\nWhat sets AI benchmarks apart from traditional performance metrics is their inherent variability, introducing accuracy as a fundamental dimension of evaluation. Unlike conventional benchmarks, which measure fixed, deterministic characteristics like computational speed or energy consumption, AI benchmarks must account for the probabilistic nature of machine learning models. The same system can produce different results depending on the data it encounters, making accuracy a defining factor in performance assessment. This distinction adds complexity, as benchmarking AI systems requires not only measuring raw computational efficiency but also understanding trade-offs between accuracy, generalization, and resource constraints.\n\nThe growing complexity and ubiquity of machine learning systems demand comprehensive benchmarking across all three dimensions: algorithmic models, hardware systems, and training data. This multifaceted evaluation approach represents a significant departure from earlier benchmarks that could focus on isolated aspects like computational speed or energy efficiency ([Hernandez and Brown 2020](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-hernandez2020measuring)). Modern machine learning benchmarks must address the sophisticated interplay between these dimensions, as limitations in any one area can fundamentally constrain overall system performance.\n\n Hernandez, Danny, and Tom B. Brown. 2020. “Measuring the Algorithmic Efficiency of Neural Networks.”_arXiv Preprint arXiv:2007.03051_, May.

[https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922](https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922). \n\nThis evolution in benchmark complexity mirrors the field’s deepening understanding of what drives machine learning system success. While algorithmic innovations initially dominated progress metrics, the challenges of deploying models at scale revealed the critical importance of hardware efficiency ([Jouppi et al. 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-jouppi2021ten)). Subsequently, high-profile failures of machine learning systems in real-world deployments highlighted how data quality and representation fundamentally determine system reliability and fairness ([Bender et al. 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-bender2021stochastic)). Understanding how these dimensions interact has become essential for accurately assessing machine learning system performance, informing development decisions, and measuring technological progress in the field.\n\n### 12.3.1 Algorithmic Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#algorithmic-benchmarks)\n\nAI algorithms must balance multiple interconnected performance objectives, including accuracy, speed, resource efficiency, and generalization capability. As machine learning applications span diverse domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning, evaluating these objectives requires standardized methodologies tailored to each domain’s unique challenges. Algorithmic benchmarks, such as ImageNet ([Deng et al. 2009](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-deng2009imagenet)), establish these evaluation frameworks, providing a consistent basis for comparing different machine learning approaches.\n\n Definition of Machine Learning Algorithmic Benchmarks \n\n**ML Algorithmic benchmarks** refer to the evaluation of machine learning models on _standardized tasks_ using _predefined datasets and metrics_. These benchmarks measure _accuracy, efficiency, and generalization_ to ensure _objective comparisons_ across different models. Algorithmic benchmarks provide _performance baselines_, enabling systematic assessment of _trade-offs between model complexity and computational cost_. They drive _technological progress_ by tracking improvements over time and identifying _limitations_ in existing approaches.\n\nAlgorithmic benchmarks serve several critical functions in advancing AI. They establish clear performance baselines, enabling objective comparisons between competing approaches. By systematically evaluating trade-offs between model complexity, computational requirements, and task performance, they help researchers and practitioners identify optimal design choices. Moreover, they track technological progress by documenting improvements over time, guiding the development of new techniques while exposing limitations in existing methodologies.\n\nFor instance, the graph in [Figure 12.1](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-imagenet-challenge) illustrates the significant reduction in error rates on the [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) classification task over the years. Starting from the baseline models in 2010 and 2011, the introduction of AlexNet in 2012 marked a substantial improvement, reducing the error rate from 25.8% to 16.4%. Subsequent models like ZFNet, VGGNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet continued this trend, with ResNet achieving a remarkable error rate of 3.57% by 2015. This progression highlights how algorithmic benchmarks not only measure current capabilities but also drive continuous advancements in AI performance.\n\n[![Image 2](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking_files/figure-html/fig-imagenet-challenge-1.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking_files/figure-html/fig-imagenet-challenge-1.png "Figure\xa012.1: ImageNet accuracy improvements over the years.")\n\n Figure 12.1: ImageNet accuracy improvements over the years. \n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-imagenet-challenge)\n\n### 12.3.2 System Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#system-benchmarks)\n\nAI computations, particularly in machine learning, place extraordinary demands on computational resources. The underlying hardware infrastructure, encompassing general-purpose CPUs, graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), fundamentally determines the speed, efficiency, and scalability of AI solutions. System benchmarks establish standardized methodologies for evaluating hardware performance across diverse AI workloads, measuring critical metrics including computational throughput, memory bandwidth, power efficiency, and scaling characteristics ([Reddi et al. 2019](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-reddi2020mlperf); [Mattson et al. 2020](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-mattson2020mlperf)).\n\n Mattson, Peter, Vijay Janapa Reddi, Christine Cheng, Cody Coleman, Greg Diamos, David Kanter, Paulius Micikevicius, et al. 2020. “MLPerf: An Industry Standard Benchmark Suite for Machine Learning Performance.”_IEEE Micro_ 40 (2): 8–16. [https://doi.org/10.1109/mm.2020.2974843](https://doi.org/10.1109/mm.2020.2974843). \n\n Definition of Machine Learning System Benchmarks \n\n**ML System benchmarks** refer to the evaluation of _computational infrastructure_ used to execute AI workloads, assessing _performance, efficiency, and scalability_ under standardized conditions. These benchmarks measure _throughput, latency, and resource utilization_ to ensure _objective comparisons_ across different system configurations. System benchmarks provide _insights into workload efficiency_, guiding _infrastructure selection, system optimization,_ and _advancements in computational architectures_.\n\nThese benchmarks fulfill two essential functions in the AI ecosystem. First, they enable developers and organizations to make informed decisions when selecting hardware platforms for their AI applications by providing comprehensive comparative performance data across system configurations. Critical evaluation factors include training speed, inference latency, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Second, hardware manufacturers rely on these benchmarks to quantify generational improvements and guide the development of specialized AI accelerators, driving continuous advancement in computational capabilities.\n\nSystem benchmarks evaluate performance across multiple scales, ranging from single-chip configurations to large distributed systems, and diverse AI workloads including both training and inference tasks. This comprehensive evaluation approach ensures that benchmarks accurately reflect real-world deployment scenarios and deliver actionable insights that inform both hardware selection decisions and system architecture design. For example, [Figure 12.2](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-imagenet-gpus) illustrates the correlation between ImageNet classification error rates and GPU adoption from 2010 to 2014. These results clearly highlight how improved hardware capabilities, combined with algorithmic advances, drove significant progress in computer vision performance.\n\n[![Image 3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking_files/figure-html/fig-imagenet-gpus-1.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking_files/figure-html/fig-imagenet-gpus-1.png "Figure\xa012.2: ImageNet accuracy improvements and use of GPUs since the dawn of AlexNet in 2012.")\n\n Figure 12.2: ImageNet accuracy improvements and use of GPUs since the dawn of AlexNet in 2012. \n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-imagenet-gpus)\n\n### 12.3.3 Data Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#data-benchmarks)\n\nData quality, scale, and diversity fundamentally shape machine learning system performance, directly influencing how effectively algorithms learn and generalize to new situations. Data benchmarks establish standardized datasets and evaluation methodologies that enable consistent comparison of different approaches. These frameworks assess critical aspects of data quality, including domain coverage, potential biases, and resilience to real-world variations in input data ([Gebru et al. 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-gebru2021datasheets)).\n\n Gebru, Timnit, Jamie Morgenstern, Briana Vecchione, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, Hanna Wallach, Hal Daumé III, and Kate Crawford. 2021. “Datasheets for Datasets.”_Communications of the ACM_ 64 (12): 86–92. [https://doi.org/10.1145/3458723](https://doi.org/10.1145/3458723). \n\n Definition of Machine Learning Data Benchmarks \n\n**ML Data benchmarks** refer to the evaluation of _datasets and data quality_ in machine learning, assessing _coverage, bias, and robustness_ under standardized conditions. These benchmarks measure _data representativeness, consistency, and impact on model performance_ to ensure _objective comparisons_ across different AI approaches. Data benchmarks provide _insights into data reliability_, guiding _dataset selection, bias mitigation,_ and _improvements in data-driven AI systems_.\n\nData benchmarks serve an essential function in understanding AI system behavior under diverse data conditions. Through systematic evaluation, they help identify common failure modes, expose gaps in data coverage, and reveal underlying biases that could impact model behavior in deployment. By providing common frameworks for data evaluation, these benchmarks enable the AI community to systematically improve data quality and address potential issues before deploying systems in production environments. This proactive approach to data quality assessment has become increasingly critical as AI systems take on more complex and consequential tasks across different domains.\n\n### 12.3.4 Community Consensus[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#community-consensus)\n\nThe proliferation of benchmarks spanning performance, energy efficiency, and domain-specific applications creates a fundamental challenge: establishing industry-wide standards. While early computing benchmarks primarily measured processor speed and memory bandwidth, modern benchmarks evaluate sophisticated aspects of system performance, from power consumption profiles to application-specific capabilities. This evolution in scope and complexity necessitates comprehensive validation and consensus from the computing community, particularly in rapidly evolving fields like machine learning where performance must be evaluated across multiple interdependent dimensions.\n\nThe lasting impact of a benchmark depends fundamentally on its acceptance by the research community, where technical excellence alone proves insufficient. Benchmarks developed without broad community input often fail to gain traction, frequently missing metrics that leading research groups consider essential. Successful benchmarks emerge through collaborative development involving academic institutions, industry partners, and domain experts. This inclusive approach ensures benchmarks evaluate capabilities most crucial for advancing the field, while balancing theoretical and practical considerations.\n\nBenchmarks developed through extensive collaboration among respected institutions carry the authority necessary to drive widespread adoption, while those perceived as advancing particular corporate interests face skepticism and limited acceptance. The success of ImageNet demonstrates how sustained community engagement through workshops and challenges establishes long-term viability. This community-driven development creates a foundation for formal standardization, where organizations like IEEE and ISO transform these benchmarks into official standards.\n\nThe standardization process provides crucial infrastructure for benchmark formalization and adoption. [IEEE working groups](https://standards.ieee.org/develop/wg/) transform community-developed benchmarking methodologies into formal industry standards, establishing precise specifications for measurement and reporting. The [IEEE 2416-2019](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2416/7065/) standard for system power modeling exemplifies this process, codifying best practices developed through community consensus. Similarly, [ISO/IEC technical committees](https://www.iso.org/committee/45020.html) develop international standards for benchmark validation and certification, ensuring consistent evaluation across global research and industry communities. These organizations bridge the gap between community-driven innovation and formal standardization, providing frameworks that enable reliable comparison of results across different institutions and geographic regions.\n\nSuccessful community benchmarks establish clear governance structures for managing their evolution. Through rigorous version control systems and detailed change documentation, benchmarks maintain backward compatibility while incorporating new advances. This governance includes formal processes for proposing, reviewing, and implementing changes, ensuring that benchmarks remain relevant while maintaining stability. Modern benchmarks increasingly emphasize reproducibility requirements, incorporating automated verification systems and standardized evaluation environments.\n\nOpen access accelerates benchmark adoption and ensures consistent implementation. Projects that provide open-source reference implementations, comprehensive documentation, validation suites, and containerized evaluation environments reduce barriers to entry. This standardization enables research groups to evaluate solutions using uniform methods and metrics. Without such coordinated implementation frameworks, organizations might interpret benchmarks inconsistently, compromising result reproducibility and meaningful comparison across studies.\n\nThe most successful benchmarks strike a careful balance between academic rigor and industry practicality. Academic involvement ensures theoretical soundness and comprehensive evaluation methodology, while industry participation grounds benchmarks in practical constraints and real-world applications. This balance proves particularly crucial in machine learning benchmarks, where theoretical advances must translate to practical improvements in deployed systems ([Patterson et al. 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-patterson2021carbon)).\n\n Patterson, David, Joseph Gonzalez, Quoc Le, Chen Liang, Lluis-Miquel Munguia, Daniel Rothchild, David So, Maud Texier, and Jeff Dean. 2021. “Carbon Emissions and Large Neural Network Training.”_arXiv Preprint arXiv:2104.10350_, April. [http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10350v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10350v3). \n\nCommunity consensus establishes enduring benchmark relevance, while fragmentation impedes scientific progress. Through collaborative development and transparent operation, benchmarks evolve into authoritative standards for measuring advancement. The most successful benchmarks in energy efficiency and domain-specific applications share this foundation of community development and governance, demonstrating how collective expertise and shared purpose create lasting impact in rapidly advancing fields.\n\n12.4 Benchmark Components[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#benchmark-components)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn AI benchmark provides a structured framework for evaluating artificial intelligence systems. While individual benchmarks vary in their specific focus, they share common components that enable systematic evaluation and comparison of AI models.\n\n[Figure 12.3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmark-components) illustrates the structured workflow of a benchmark implementation, showcasing how components like task definition, dataset selection, model selection, and evaluation interconnect to form a complete evaluation pipeline. This visualization highlights how each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring systematic and reproducible AI performance assessment.\n\n[![Image 4](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/benchmarking_components.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/benchmarking_components.png "Figure\xa012.3: Example of benchmark components.")\n\n Figure 12.3: Example of benchmark components. \n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmark-components)\n\n### 12.4.1 Problem Definition[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#problem-definition)\n\nA benchmark implementation begins with a formal specification of the machine learning task and its evaluation criteria. In machine learning, tasks represent well-defined problems that AI systems must solve. Consider an anomaly detection system that processes audio signals to identify deviations from normal operation patterns, as shown in [Figure 12.3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmark-components). This industrial monitoring application exemplifies how formal task specifications translate into practical implementations.\n\nThe formal definition of a benchmark task encompasses both the computational problem and its evaluation framework. While the specific tasks vary by domain, well-established categories have emerged across fields. Natural language processing tasks, for example, include machine translation, question answering ([Hirschberg and Manning 2015](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-hirschberg2015advances)), and text classification. Computer vision similarly employs standardized tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and facial recognition ([Everingham et al. 2009](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-everingham2010pascal)).\n\n Hirschberg, Julia, and Christopher D. Manning. 2015. “Advances in Natural Language Processing.”_Science_ 349 (6245): 261–66. [https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa8685](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa8685). \n\n Everingham, Mark, Luc Van Gool, Christopher K. I. Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. 2009. “The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge.”_International Journal of Computer Vision_ 88 (2): 303–38. [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-009-0275-4](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-009-0275-4). \n\nEvery benchmark task specification must define three fundamental elements. The input specification determines what data the system processes. In [Figure 12.3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmark-components), this consists of audio waveform data. The output specification describes the required system response, such as the binary classification of normal versus anomalous patterns. The performance specification establishes quantitative requirements for accuracy, processing speed, and resource utilization.\n\nTask design directly impacts the benchmark’s ability to evaluate AI systems effectively. The audio anomaly detection example illustrates this relationship through its specific requirements: processing continuous signal data, adapting to varying noise conditions, and operating within strict time constraints. These practical constraints create a detailed framework for assessing model performance, ensuring evaluations reflect real-world operational demands.\n\nThe implementation of a benchmark proceeds systematically from this task definition. Each subsequent phase - from dataset selection through deployment - builds upon these initial specifications, ensuring that evaluations maintain consistency while addressing the defined requirements across different approaches and implementations.\n\n### 12.4.2 Standardized Datasets[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#standardized-datasets)\n\nBuilding upon the problem definition, standardized datasets provide the foundation for training and evaluating models. These carefully curated collections ensure all models undergo testing under identical conditions, enabling direct comparisons across different approaches and architectures. [Figure 12.3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmark-components) demonstrates this through an audio anomaly detection example, where waveform data serves as the standardized input for evaluating detection performance.\n\nIn computer vision, datasets such as [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/)([Deng et al. 2009](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-deng2009imagenet)), [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/)([Lin et al. 2014](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-lin2014microsoft)), and [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)([Krizhevsky, Hinton, et al. 2009](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-krizhevsky2009learning)) serve as reference standards. For natural language processing, collections such as [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)([Rajpurkar et al. 2016](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-rajpurkar2016squad)), [GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com/)([Wang et al. 2018](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-wang2018glue)), and [WikiText](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/)([Merity et al. 2016](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-merity2016pointer)) fulfill similar functions. These datasets encompass a range of complexities and edge cases to thoroughly evaluate machine learning systems.\n\n Krizhevsky, Alex, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. 2009. “Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images.”\n\n Rajpurkar, Pranav, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. 2016. “SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text.”_arXiv Preprint arXiv:1606.05250_, June, 2383–92. [https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/d16-1264](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/d16-1264). \n\n Merity, Stephen, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. 2016. “Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models.”_arXiv Preprint arXiv:1609.07843_, September. [http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07843v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07843v1). \n\nThe strategic selection of datasets, shown early in the workflow of [Figure 12.3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmark-components), shapes all subsequent implementation steps and determines the benchmark’s effectiveness. In the audio anomaly detection example, the dataset must include representative waveform samples of normal operation alongside examples of various anomalous conditions. Notable examples include datasets like ToyADMOS for industrial manufacturing anomalies and Google Speech Commands for general sound recognition. Regardless of the specific dataset chosen, the data volume must suffice for both model training and validation, while incorporating real-world signal characteristics and noise patterns that reflect deployment conditions.\n\nThe selection of benchmark datasets fundamentally shapes experimental outcomes and model evaluation. Effective datasets must balance two key requirements: accurately representing real-world challenges while maintaining sufficient complexity to differentiate model performance meaningfully. While research often utilizes simplified datasets like ToyADMOS ([Koizumi et al. 2019](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-koizumi2019toyadmos)), these controlled environments, though valuable for methodological development, may not fully capture real-world deployment complexities. Benchmark development frequently necessitates combining multiple datasets due to access limitations on proprietary industrial data. As machine learning capabilities advance, benchmark datasets must similarly evolve to maintain their utility in evaluating contemporary systems and emerging challenges.\n\n Koizumi, Yuma, Shoichiro Saito, Hisashi Uematsu, Noboru Harada, and Keisuke Imoto. 2019. “ToyADMOS: A Dataset of Miniature-Machine Operating Sounds for Anomalous Sound Detection.” In _2019 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)_, 313–17. IEEE; IEEE. [https://doi.org/10.1109/waspaa.2019.8937164](https://doi.org/10.1109/waspaa.2019.8937164). \n\n### 12.4.3 Model Selection[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#model-selection)\n\nThe benchmark process advances systematically from initial task definition to model architecture selection and implementation. This critical phase establishes performance baselines and determines the optimal modeling approach. [Figure 12.3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmark-components) illustrates this progression through the model selection stage and subsequent training code development.\n\nBaseline models serve as the reference points for evaluating novel approaches. These span from basic implementations, including linear regression for continuous predictions and logistic regression for classification tasks, to advanced architectures with proven success in comparable domains. In natural language processing applications, transformer-based models like BERT have emerged as standard benchmarks for comparative analysis.\n\nSelecting the right baseline model requires careful evaluation of architectures against benchmark requirements. This selection process directly informs the development of training code, which forms the cornerstone of benchmark reproducibility. The training implementation must thoroughly document all aspects of the model pipeline, from data preprocessing through training procedures, enabling precise replication of model behavior across research teams.\n\nModel development follows two primary optimization paths: training and inference. During training optimization, efforts concentrate on achieving target accuracy metrics while operating within computational constraints. The training implementation must demonstrate consistent achievement of performance thresholds under specified conditions.\n\nThe inference optimization path addresses deployment considerations, particularly the transition from development to production environments. A key example involves precision reduction through quantization, progressing from FP32 to INT8 representations to enhance deployment efficiency. This process demands careful calibration to maintain model accuracy while reducing resource requirements. The benchmark must detail both the quantization methodology and verification procedures that confirm preserved performance.\n\nThe intersection of these optimization paths with real-world constraints shapes deployment strategy. Comprehensive benchmarks must therefore specify requirements for both training and inference scenarios, ensuring models maintain consistent performance from development through deployment. This crucial connection between development and production metrics naturally leads to the establishment of evaluation criteria.\n\nThe optimization process must balance four key objectives: model accuracy, computational speed, memory utilization, and energy efficiency. This complex optimization landscape necessitates robust evaluation metrics that can effectively quantify performance across all dimensions. As models transition from development to deployment, these metrics serve as critical tools for guiding optimization decisions and validating performance enhancements.\n\n### 12.4.4 Evaluation Metrics[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#evaluation-metrics)\n\nWhile model selection establishes the architectural framework, evaluation metrics provide the quantitative measures needed to assess machine learning model performance. These metrics establish objective standards for comparing different approaches, enabling researchers and practitioners to gauge solution effectiveness. The selection of appropriate metrics represents a fundamental aspect of benchmark design, as they must align with task objectives while providing meaningful insights into model behavior across both training and deployment scenarios.\n\nTask-specific metrics quantify a model’s performance on its intended function. Classification tasks employ metrics including accuracy (overall correct predictions), precision (positive prediction accuracy), recall (positive case detection rate), and F1 score (precision-recall harmonic mean) ([Sokolova and Lapalme 2009](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-sokolova2009systematic)). Regression problems utilize error measurements like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess prediction accuracy. Domain-specific applications often require specialized metrics - for example, machine translation uses the BLEU score to evaluate the semantic and syntactic similarity between machine-generated and human reference translations ([Papineni et al. 2001](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-papineni2002bleu)).\n\n Sokolova, Marina, and Guy Lapalme. 2009. “A Systematic Analysis of Performance Measures for Classification Tasks.”_Information Processing &Amp; Management_ 45 (4): 427–37. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2009.03.002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2009.03.002). \n\n Papineni, Kishore, Salim Roukos, Todd Ward, and Wei-Jing Zhu. 2001. “BLEU: A Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation.” In _Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics - ACL ’02_, 311. Association for Computational Linguistics. [https://doi.org/10.3115/1073083.1073135](https://doi.org/10.3115/1073083.1073135). \n\nAs models transition from research to production deployment, implementation metrics become equally important. Model size, measured in parameters or memory footprint, affects deployment feasibility across different hardware platforms. Processing latency, typically measured in milliseconds per inference, determines whether the model meets real-time requirements. Energy consumption, measured in watts or joules per inference, indicates operational efficiency. These practical considerations reflect the growing need for solutions that balance accuracy with computational efficiency.\n\nThe selection of appropriate metrics requires careful consideration of task requirements and deployment constraints. A single metric rarely captures all relevant aspects of performance. For instance, in anomaly detection systems, high accuracy alone may not indicate good performance if the model generates frequent false alarms. Similarly, a fast model with poor accuracy fails to provide practical value.\n\n[Figure 12.3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmark-components) demonstrates this multi-metric evaluation approach. The anomaly detection system reports performance across multiple dimensions: model size (270 Kparameters), processing speed (10.4 ms/inference), and detection accuracy (0.86 AUC). This combination of metrics ensures the model meets both technical and operational requirements in real-world deployment scenarios.\n\n### 12.4.5 Benchmark Harness[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#benchmark-harness)\n\nEvaluation metrics provide the measurement framework, while a benchmark harness implements the systematic infrastructure for evaluating model performance under controlled conditions. This critical component ensures reproducible testing by managing how inputs are delivered to the system under test and how measurements are collected, effectively transforming theoretical metrics into quantifiable measurements.\n\nThe harness design should align with the intended deployment scenario and usage patterns. For server deployments, the harness implements request patterns that simulate real-world traffic, typically generating inputs using a Poisson distribution to model random but statistically consistent server workloads. The harness manages concurrent requests and varying load intensities to evaluate system behavior under different operational conditions.\n\nFor embedded and mobile applications, the harness generates input patterns that reflect actual deployment conditions. This might involve sequential image injection for mobile vision applications or synchronized multi-sensor streams for autonomous systems. Such precise input generation and timing control ensures the system experiences realistic operational patterns, revealing performance characteristics that would emerge in actual device deployment.\n\nThe harness must also accommodate different throughput models. Batch processing scenarios require the ability to evaluate system performance on large volumes of parallel inputs, while real-time applications need precise timing control for sequential processing. [Figure 12.3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmark-components) illustrates this in the embedded implementation phase, where the harness must support precise measurement of inference time and energy consumption per operation.\n\nReproducibility demands that the harness maintain consistent testing conditions across different evaluation runs. This includes controlling environmental factors such as background processes, thermal conditions, and power states that might affect performance measurements. The harness must also provide mechanisms for collecting and logging performance metrics without significantly impacting the system under test.\n\n### 12.4.6 System Specifications[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#system-specifications)\n\nBeyond the benchmark harness that controls test execution, system specifications are fundamental components of machine learning benchmarks that directly impact model performance, training time, and experimental reproducibility. These specifications encompass the complete computational environment, ensuring that benchmarking results can be properly contextualized, compared, and reproduced by other researchers.\n\nHardware specifications typically include:\n\n1.   Processor type and speed (e.g., CPU model, clock rate)\n2.   GPUs, or TPUs, including model, memory capacity, and quantity if used for distributed training\n3.   Memory capacity and type (e.g., RAM size, DDR4)\n4.   Storage type and capacity (e.g., SSD, HDD)\n5.   Network configuration, if relevant for distributed computing\n\nSoftware specifications generally include:\n\n1.   Operating system and version\n2.   Programming language and version\n3.   Machine learning frameworks and libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) with version numbers\n4.   Compiler information and optimization flags\n5.   Custom software or scripts used in the benchmark process\n6.   Environment management tools and configuration (e.g., Docker containers, virtual environments)\n\nThe precise documentation of these specifications is essential for experimental validity and reproducibility. This documentation enables other researchers to replicate the benchmark environment with high fidelity, provides critical context for interpreting performance metrics, and facilitates understanding of resource requirements and scaling characteristics across different models and tasks.\n\nIn many cases, benchmarks may include results from multiple hardware configurations to provide a more comprehensive view of model performance across different computational environments. This approach is particularly valuable as it highlights the trade-offs between model complexity, computational resources, and performance.\n\nAs the field evolves, hardware and software specifications increasingly incorporate detailed energy consumption metrics and computational efficiency measures, such as FLOPS/watt and total power usage over training time. This expansion reflects growing concerns about the environmental impact of large-scale machine learning models and supports the development of more sustainable AI practices. Comprehensive specification documentation thus serves multiple purposes: enabling reproducibility, supporting fair comparisons, and advancing both the technical and environmental aspects of machine learning research.\n\n### 12.4.7 Run Rules[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#run-rules)\n\nRun rules establish the procedural framework that ensures benchmark results can be reliably replicated by researchers and practitioners, complementing the technical environment defined by system specifications. These guidelines are fundamental for validating research claims, building upon existing work, and advancing machine learning. Central to reproducibility in AI benchmarks is the management of controlled randomness—the systematic handling of stochastic processes such as weight initialization and data shuffling that ensures consistent, verifiable results.\n\nComprehensive documentation of hyperparameters forms a critical component of reproducibility. Hyperparameters are configuration settings that govern the learning process independently of the training data, including learning rates, batch sizes, and network architectures. Given that minor hyperparameter adjustments can significantly impact model performance, their precise documentation is essential. Additionally, benchmarks mandate the preservation and sharing of training and evaluation datasets. When direct data sharing is restricted by privacy or licensing constraints, benchmarks must provide detailed specifications for data preprocessing and selection criteria, enabling researchers to construct comparable datasets or understand the characteristics of the original experimental data.\n\nCode provenance and availability constitute another vital aspect of reproducibility guidelines. Contemporary benchmarks typically require researchers to publish implementation code in version-controlled repositories, encompassing not only the model implementation but also comprehensive scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation. Advanced benchmarks often provide containerized environments that encapsulate all dependencies and configurations. Furthermore, detailed experimental logging is mandatory, including systematic recording of training metrics, model checkpoints, and documentation of any experimental adjustments.\n\nThese reproducibility guidelines serve multiple crucial functions: they enhance transparency, enable rigorous peer review, and accelerate scientific progress in AI research. By following these protocols, the research community can effectively verify results, iterate on successful approaches, and identify methodological limitations. In the rapidly evolving landscape of machine learning, these robust reproducibility practices form the foundation for reliable and progressive research.\n\n### 12.4.8 Result Interpretation[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#result-interpretation)\n\nBuilding upon the foundation established by run rules, result interpretation guidelines provide the essential framework for understanding and contextualizing benchmark outcomes. These guidelines help researchers and practitioners draw meaningful conclusions from benchmark results, ensuring fair and informative comparisons between different models or approaches. A fundamental aspect is understanding the statistical significance of performance differences. Benchmarks typically specify protocols for conducting statistical tests and reporting confidence intervals, enabling practitioners to distinguish between meaningful improvements and variations attributable to random factors.\n\nResult interpretation requires careful consideration of real-world applications. While a 1% improvement in accuracy might be crucial for medical diagnostics or financial systems, other applications might prioritize inference speed or model efficiency over marginal accuracy gains. Understanding these context-specific requirements is essential for meaningful interpretation of benchmark results. Users must also recognize inherent benchmark limitations, as no single evaluation framework can encompass all possible use cases. Common limitations include dataset biases, task-specific characteristics, and constraints of evaluation metrics.\n\nModern benchmarks often necessitate multi-dimensional analysis across various performance metrics. For instance, when a model demonstrates superior accuracy but requires substantially more computational resources, interpretation guidelines help practitioners evaluate these trade-offs based on their specific constraints and requirements. The guidelines also address the critical issue of benchmark overfitting, where models might be excessively optimized for specific benchmark tasks at the expense of real-world generalization. To mitigate this risk, guidelines often recommend evaluating model performance on related but distinct tasks and considering practical deployment scenarios.\n\nThese comprehensive interpretation frameworks ensure that benchmarks serve their intended purpose: providing standardized performance measurements while enabling nuanced understanding of model capabilities. This balanced approach supports evidence-based decision-making in both research contexts and practical machine learning applications.\n\n### 12.4.9 Example Benchmark[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#example-benchmark)\n\nA benchmark run evaluates system performance by synthesizing multiple components under controlled conditions to produce reproducible measurements. [Figure 12.3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmark-components) illustrates this integration through an audio anomaly detection system. It shows how performance metrics are systematically measured and reported within a framework that encompasses problem definition, datasets, model selection, evaluation criteria, and standardized run rules.\n\nThe benchmark measures several key performance dimensions. For computational resources, the system reports a model size of 270 Kparameters and requires 10.4 milliseconds per inference. For task effectiveness, it achieves a detection accuracy of 0.86 AUC (Area Under Curve) in distinguishing normal from anomalous audio patterns. For operational efficiency, it consumes 516 µJ of energy per inference.\n\nThe relative importance of these metrics varies by deployment context. Energy consumption per inference is critical for battery-powered devices but less consequential for systems with constant power supply. Model size constraints differ significantly between cloud deployments with abundant resources and embedded devices with limited memory. Processing speed requirements depend on whether the system must operate in real-time or can process data in batches.\n\nThe benchmark reveals inherent trade-offs between performance metrics in machine learning systems. For instance, reducing the model size from 270 Kparameters might improve processing speed and energy efficiency but could decrease the 0.86 AUC detection accuracy. [Figure 12.3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmark-components) illustrates how these interconnected metrics contribute to overall system performance in the deployment phase.\n\nWhether these measurements constitute a “passing” benchmark depends on the specific requirements of the intended application. The benchmark framework provides the structure and methodology for consistent evaluation, while the acceptance criteria must align with deployment constraints and performance requirements.\n\n12.5 Benchmarking Granularity[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#benchmarking-granularity)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile benchmarking components individually provides detailed insights into model selection, dataset efficiency, and evaluation metrics, a complete assessment of machine learning systems requires analyzing performance across different levels of abstraction. Benchmarks can range from fine-grained evaluations of individual tensor operations to holistic end-to-end measurements of full AI pipelines.\n\nSystem level benchmarking provides a structured and systematic approach to assessing a ML system’s performance across various dimensions. Given the complexity of ML systems, we can dissect their performance through different levels of granularity and obtain a comprehensive view of the system’s efficiency, identify potential bottlenecks, and pinpoint areas for improvement. To this end, various types of benchmarks have evolved over the years and continue to persist.\n\n[Figure 12.4](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-granularity) shows the different layers of granularity of an ML system. At the application level, end-to-end benchmarks assess the overall system performance, considering factors like data preprocessing, model training, and inference. While at the model layer, benchmarks focus on assessing the efficiency and accuracy of specific models. This includes evaluating how well models generalize to new data and their computational efficiency during training and inference. Furthermore, benchmarking can extend to hardware and software infrastructure, examining the performance of individual components like GPUs or TPUs.\n\n[![Image 5](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/end2end.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/end2end.png "Figure\xa012.4: ML system granularity.")\n\n Figure 12.4: ML system granularity. \n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-granularity)\n\n### 12.5.1 Micro Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#micro-benchmarks)\n\nMicro-benchmarks are specialized evaluation tools that assess distinct components or specific operations within a broader machine learning process. These benchmarks isolate individual tasks to provide detailed insights into the computational demands of particular system elements, from neural network layers to optimization techniques to activation functions. For example, micro-benchmarks might measure the time required to execute a convolutional layer in a deep learning model or evaluate the speed of data preprocessing operations that prepare training data.\n\nA key area of micro-benchmarking focuses on tensor operations, which are the computational foundation of deep learning. Libraries like [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) by NVIDIA provide benchmarks for measuring fundamental computations such as convolutions and matrix multiplications across different hardware configurations. These measurements help developers understand how their hardware handles the core mathematical operations that dominate ML workloads.\n\nMicro-benchmarks also examine activation functions and neural network layers in isolation. This includes measuring the performance of various activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh under controlled conditions, as well as evaluating the computational efficiency of distinct neural network components such as LSTM cells or Transformer blocks when processing standardized inputs.\n\n[DeepBench](https://github.com/baidu-research/DeepBench), developed by Baidu, was one of the first to demonstrate the value of comprehensive micro-benchmarking. It evaluates these fundamental operations across different hardware platforms, providing detailed performance data that helps developers optimize their deep learning implementations. By isolating and measuring individual operations, DeepBench enables precise comparison of hardware platforms and identification of potential performance bottlenecks.\n\n### 12.5.2 Macro Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#macro-benchmarks)\n\nWhile micro-benchmarks examine individual operations like tensor computations and layer performance, macro benchmarks evaluate complete machine learning models. This shift from component-level to model-level assessment provides insights into how architectural choices and component interactions affect overall model behavior. For instance, while micro-benchmarks might show optimal performance for individual convolutional layers, macro-benchmarks reveal how these layers work together within a complete convolutional neural network.\n\nMacro-benchmarks measure multiple performance dimensions that emerge only at the model level. These include prediction accuracy, which shows how well the model generalizes to new data; memory consumption patterns across different batch sizes and sequence lengths; throughput under varying computational loads; and latency across different hardware configurations. Understanding these metrics helps developers make informed decisions about model architecture, optimization strategies, and deployment configurations.\n\nThe assessment of complete models occurs under standardized conditions using established datasets and tasks. For example, computer vision models might be evaluated on [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/), measuring both computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. Natural language processing models might be assessed on translation tasks, examining how they balance quality and speed across different language pairs.\n\nSeveral industry-standard benchmarks enable consistent model evaluation across platforms. [MLPerf Inference](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference) provides comprehensive testing suites adapted for different computational environments ([Reddi et al. 2019](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-reddi2020mlperf)). [MLPerf Mobile](https://github.com/mlcommons/mobile_app_open) focuses on mobile device constraints ([Janapa Reddi et al. 2022](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-janapa2022mlperf)), while [MLPerf Tiny](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny) addresses microcontroller deployments ([Banbury et al. 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-banbury2021mlperf)). For embedded systems, [EEMBC’s MLMark](https://github.com/eembc/mlmark) emphasizes both performance and power efficiency. The [AI-Benchmark](https://ai-benchmark.com/) suite specializes in mobile platforms, evaluating models across diverse tasks from image recognition to face parsing.\n\n Janapa Reddi, Vijay et al. 2022. “MLPerf Mobile V2. 0: An Industry-Standard Benchmark Suite for Mobile Machine Learning.” In _Proceedings of Machine Learning and Systems_, 4:806–23. \n\n Banbury, Colby, Vijay Janapa Reddi, Peter Torelli, Jeremy Holleman, Nat Jeffries, Csaba Kiraly, Pietro Montino, et al. 2021. “MLPerf Tiny Benchmark.”_arXiv Preprint arXiv:2106.07597_, June. [http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07597v4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07597v4). \n\n### 12.5.3 End-to-End Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#end-to-end-benchmarks)\n\nEnd-to-end benchmarks provide an all-inclusive evaluation that extends beyond the boundaries of the ML model itself. Rather than focusing solely on a machine learning model’s computational efficiency or accuracy, these benchmarks encompass the entire pipeline of an AI system. This includes initial ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) or ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) data processing, the core model’s performance, post-processing of results, and critical infrastructure components like storage and network systems.\n\nData processing is the foundation of all AI systems, transforming raw data into a format suitable for model training or inference. In ETL pipelines, data undergoes extraction from source systems, transformation through cleaning and feature engineering, and loading into model-ready formats. These preprocessing steps’ efficiency, scalability, and accuracy significantly impact overall system performance. End-to-end benchmarks must assess standardized datasets through these pipelines to ensure data preparation doesn’t become a bottleneck.\n\nThe post-processing phase plays an equally important role. This involves interpreting the model’s raw outputs, converting scores into meaningful categories, filtering results based on predefined tasks, or integrating with other systems. For instance, a computer vision system might need to post-process detection boundaries, apply confidence thresholds, and format results for downstream applications. In real-world deployments, this phase proves crucial for delivering actionable insights.\n\nBeyond core AI operations, infrastructure components heavily influence overall performance and user experience. Storage solutions, whether cloud-based, on-premises, or hybrid, can significantly impact data retrieval and storage times, especially with vast AI datasets. Network interactions, vital for distributed systems, can become performance bottlenecks if not optimized. End-to-end benchmarks must evaluate these components under specified environmental conditions to ensure reproducible measurements of the entire system.\n\nTo date, there are no public, end-to-end benchmarks that fully account for data storage, network, and compute performance. While MLPerf Training and Inference approach end-to-end evaluation, they primarily focus on model performance rather than real-world deployment scenarios. Nonetheless, they provide valuable baseline metrics for assessing AI system capabilities.\n\nGiven the inherent specificity of end-to-end benchmarking, organizations typically perform these evaluations internally by instrumenting production deployments. This allows engineers to develop result interpretation guidelines based on realistic workloads, but given the sensitivity and specificity of the information, these benchmarks rarely appear in public settings.\n\n### 12.5.4 Trade-offs[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#trade-offs)\n\nAs shown in [Table 12.1](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#tbl-benchmark-comparison), different challenges emerge at different stages of an AI system’s lifecycle. Each benchmarking approach provides unique insights: micro-benchmarks help engineers optimize specific components like GPU kernel implementations or data loading operations, macro-benchmarks guide model architecture decisions and algorithm selection, while end-to-end benchmarks reveal system-level bottlenecks in production environments.\n\n Table 12.1: Comparison of benchmarking approaches across different dimensions. Each approach offers distinct advantages and focuses on different aspects of ML system evaluation. \n\n| Component | Micro Benchmarks | Macro Benchmarks | End-to-End Benchmarks |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Focus | Individual operations | Complete models | Full system pipeline |\n| Scope | Tensor ops, layers, activations | Model architecture, training, inference | ETL, model, infrastructure |\n| Example | Conv layer performance on cuDNN | ResNet-50 on ImageNet | Production recommendation system |\n| Advantages | Precise bottleneck identification, Component optimization | Model architecture comparison, Standardized evaluation | Realistic performance assessment, System-wide insights |\n| Challenges | May miss interaction effects | Limited infrastructure insights | Complex to standardize, Often proprietary |\n| Typical Use | Hardware selection, Operation optimization | Model selection, Research comparison | Production system evaluation |\n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#tbl-benchmark-comparison)\n\nComponent interaction often produces unexpected behaviors. For example, while micro-benchmarks might show excellent performance for individual convolutional layers, and macro-benchmarks might demonstrate strong accuracy for the complete model, end-to-end evaluation could reveal that data preprocessing creates unexpected bottlenecks during high-traffic periods. These system-level insights often remain hidden when components undergo isolated testing.\n\nComponent interaction often produces unexpected behaviors.

They allow practitioners to assess how different design choices, including model architectures, data loading mechanisms, hardware configurations, and distributed training strategies, impact performance. These benchmarks are particularly vital as machine learning systems grow in scale, requiring billions of parameters, terabytes of data, and distributed computing environments.\n\nFor instance, large-scale models like [OpenAI’s GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)([Brown et al. 2020](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-brown2020language)), which consists of 175 billion parameters trained on 45 terabytes of data, highlight the immense computational demands of training. Benchmarks enable systematic evaluation of the underlying systems to ensure that hardware and software configurations can meet these demands efficiently.\n\n Definition of ML Training Benchmarks \n\n**ML Training Benchmarks** are standardized tools used to evaluate the _performance_, _efficiency_, and _scalability_ of machine learning systems during the _training phase_. These benchmarks measure key _system-level metrics_, such as _time-to-accuracy_, _throughput_, _resource utilization_, and _energy consumption_. By providing a structured evaluation framework, training benchmarks enable _fair comparisons_ across _hardware platforms_, _software frameworks_, and _distributed computing setups_. They help identify _bottlenecks_ and optimize _training processes_ for _large-scale machine learning models_, ensuring that computational resources are used effectively.\n\nEfficient data storage and delivery during training also play a major role in the training process. For instance, in a machine learning model that predicts bounding boxes around objects in an image, thousands of images may be required. However, loading an entire image dataset into memory is typically infeasible, so practitioners rely on data loaders from ML frameworks. Successful model training depends on timely and efficient data delivery, making it essential to benchmark tools like data pipelines, preprocessing speed, and storage retrieval times to understand their impact on training performance.\n\nHardware selection is another key factor in training machine learning systems, as it can significantly impact training time. Training benchmarks evaluate CPU, GPU, memory, and network utilization during the training phase to guide system optimizations. Understanding how resources are used is essential: Are GPUs being fully leveraged? Is there unnecessary memory overhead? Benchmarks can uncover bottlenecks or inefficiencies in resource utilization, leading to cost savings and performance improvements.\n\nIn many cases, using a single hardware accelerator, such as a single GPU, is insufficient to meet the computational demands of large-scale model training. Machine learning models are often trained in data centers with multiple GPUs or TPUs, where distributed computing enables parallel processing across nodes. Training benchmarks assess how efficiently the system scales across multiple nodes, manages data sharding, and handles challenges like node failures or drop-offs during training.\n\nTo illustrate these benchmarking principles, we will reference [MLPerf Training](https://mlcommons.org/benchmarks/training/) throughout this section. Briefly, MLPerf is an industry-standard benchmark suite designed to evaluate machine learning system performance. It provides standardized tests for training and inference across a range of deep learning workloads, including image classification, language modeling, object detection, and recommendation systems.\n\n### 12.6.1 Motivation[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#motivation)\n\nFrom a systems perspective, training machine learning models is a computationally intensive process that requires careful optimization of resources. Training benchmarks serve as essential tools for evaluating system efficiency, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring that machine learning systems can scale effectively. They provide a standardized approach to measuring how various system components, including hardware accelerators, memory, storage, and network infrastructure, affect training performance.\n\nTraining benchmarks enable researchers and engineers to push the state-of-the-art, optimize configurations, improve scalability, and reduce overall resource consumption by systematically evaluating these factors. As shown in [Figure 12.5](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-mlperf-training-improve), the performance improvements in progressive versions of MLPerf Training benchmarks have consistently outpaced Moore’s Law, which demonstrates that what gets measured gets improved. Using standardized benchmarking trends allows us to rigorously showcase the rapid evolution of ML computing.\n\n[![Image 6](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/mlperf_training_06-12-2024.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/mlperf_training_06-12-2024.png "Figure\xa012.5: MLPerf Training performance trends. Source: @tschand2024mlperf.")\n\n Figure 12.5: MLPerf Training performance trends. Source: Tschand et al.

The ability to measure and compare training efficiency is critical to ensuring that systems can effectively handle large-scale workloads. Training benchmarks provide a structured methodology for assessing performance across different hardware platforms, software frameworks, and optimization techniques.\n\nOne of the fundamental challenges in training machine learning models is the efficient allocation of computational resources. Training a transformer-based model such as GPT-3, which consists of 175 billion parameters and requires processing terabytes of data, places an enormous burden on modern computing infrastructure. Without standardized benchmarks, it becomes difficult to determine whether a system is fully utilizing its resources or whether inefficiencies, including slow data loading, underutilized accelerators, and excessive memory overhead, are limiting performance.\n\nTraining benchmarks help uncover such inefficiencies by measuring key performance indicators, including system throughput, time-to-accuracy, and hardware utilization. These benchmarks allow practitioners to analyze whether GPUs, TPUs, and CPUs are being leveraged effectively or whether specific bottlenecks, such as memory bandwidth constraints or inefficient data pipelines, are reducing overall system performance. For example, a system using TF32 precision1 may achieve higher throughput than one using FP32, but if TF32 introduces numerical instability that increases the number of iterations required to reach the target accuracy, the overall training time may be longer. By providing insights into these factors, benchmarks support the design of more efficient training workflows that maximize hardware potential while minimizing unnecessary computation.\n\n#### Hardware & Software Optimization[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#hardware-software-optimization)\n\nThe performance of machine learning training is heavily influenced by the choice of hardware and software. Training benchmarks guide system designers in selecting optimal configurations by measuring how different architectures, including GPUs, TPUs, and emerging AI accelerators, handle computational workloads. These benchmarks also evaluate how well deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, optimize performance across different hardware setups.\n\nFor example, the MLPerf Training benchmark suite is widely used to compare the performance of different accelerator architectures on tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. By running standardized benchmarks across multiple hardware configurations, engineers can determine whether certain accelerators are better suited for specific training workloads. This information is particularly valuable in large-scale data centers and cloud computing environments, where selecting the right combination of hardware and software can lead to significant performance gains and cost savings.\n\nBeyond hardware selection, training benchmarks also inform software optimizations. Machine learning frameworks implement various low-level optimizations, including mixed-precision training, memory-efficient data loading, and distributed training strategies, that can significantly impact system performance. Benchmarks help quantify the impact of these optimizations, ensuring that training systems are configured for maximum efficiency.\n\n#### Scalability & Efficiency[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#scalability-efficiency)\n\nAs machine learning workloads continue to grow, efficient scaling across distributed computing environments has become a key concern. Many modern deep learning models are trained across multiple GPUs or TPUs, requiring efficient parallelization strategies to ensure that additional computing resources lead to meaningful performance improvements. Training benchmarks measure how well a system scales by evaluating system throughput, memory efficiency, and overall training time as additional computational resources are introduced.\n\nEffective scaling is not always guaranteed. While adding more GPUs or TPUs should, in theory, reduce training time, issues such as communication overhead, data synchronization latency, and memory bottlenecks can limit scaling efficiency. Training benchmarks help identify these challenges by quantifying how performance scales with increasing hardware resources. A well-designed system should exhibit near-linear scaling, where doubling the number of GPUs results in a near-halving of training time. However, real-world inefficiencies often prevent perfect scaling, and benchmarks provide the necessary insights to optimize system design accordingly.\n\nAnother crucial factor in training efficiency is time-to-accuracy, which measures how quickly a model reaches a target accuracy level. Achieving faster convergence with fewer computational resources is a key goal in training optimization, and benchmarks help compare different training methodologies to determine which approaches strike the best balance between speed and accuracy. By leveraging training benchmarks, system designers can assess whether their infrastructure is capable of handling large-scale workloads efficiently while maintaining training stability and accuracy.\n\n#### Cost & Energy Factors[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#cost-energy-factors)\n\nThe computational cost of training large-scale models has risen sharply in recent years, making cost-efficiency a critical consideration. Training a model such as GPT-3 can require millions of dollars in cloud computing resources, making it imperative to evaluate cost-effectiveness across different hardware and software configurations. Training benchmarks provide a means to quantify the cost per training run by analyzing computational expenses, cloud pricing models, and energy consumption.\n\nBeyond financial cost, energy efficiency has become an increasingly important metric. Large-scale training runs consume vast amounts of electricity, contributing to significant carbon emissions. Benchmarks help evaluate energy efficiency by measuring power consumption per unit of training progress, allowing organizations to identify sustainable approaches to AI development.\n\nFor example, MLPerf includes an energy benchmarking component that tracks the power consumption of various hardware accelerators during training. This allows researchers to compare different computing platforms not only in terms of raw performance but also in terms of their environmental impact. By integrating energy efficiency metrics into benchmarking studies, organizations can design AI systems that balance computational power with sustainability goals.\n\n#### Fair ML Systems Comparison[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fair-ml-systems-comparison)\n\nOne of the primary functions of training benchmarks is to establish a standardized framework for comparing ML systems. Given the wide variety of hardware architectures, deep learning frameworks, and optimization techniques available today, ensuring fair and reproducible comparisons is essential.\n\nStandardized benchmarks provide a common evaluation methodology, allowing researchers and practitioners to assess how different training systems perform under identical conditions. For example, MLPerf Training benchmarks enable vendor-neutral comparisons by defining strict evaluation criteria for deep learning tasks such as image classification, language modeling, and recommendation systems. This ensures that performance results are meaningful and not skewed by differences in dataset preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, or implementation details.\n\nFurthermore, reproducibility is a major concern in machine learning research. Training benchmarks help address this challenge by providing clearly defined methodologies for performance evaluation, ensuring that results can be consistently reproduced across different computing environments. By adhering to standardized benchmarks, researchers can make informed decisions when selecting hardware, software, and training methodologies, ultimately driving progress in AI systems development.\n\n### 12.6.2 Metrics[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#metrics)\n\nEvaluating the performance of machine learning training requires a set of well-defined metrics that go beyond conventional algorithmic measures. From a systems perspective, training benchmarks assess how efficiently and effectively a machine learning model can be trained to a predefined accuracy threshold. Metrics such as throughput, scalability, and energy efficiency are only meaningful in relation to whether the model successfully reaches its target accuracy. Without this constraint, optimizing for raw speed or resource utilization may lead to misleading conclusions.\n\nTraining benchmarks, such as MLPerf Training, define specific accuracy targets for different machine learning tasks, ensuring that performance measurements are made in a fair and reproducible manner. A system that trains a model quickly but fails to reach the required accuracy is not considered a valid benchmark result. Conversely, a system that achieves the best possible accuracy but takes an excessive amount of time or resources may not be practically useful. Effective benchmarking requires balancing speed, efficiency, and accuracy convergence.\n\n#### Time and Throughput[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#time-and-throughput)\n\nOne of the fundamental metrics for evaluating training efficiency is the time required to reach a predefined accuracy threshold. Training time (T train) measures how long a model takes to converge to an acceptable performance level, reflecting the overall computational efficiency of the system. It is formally defined as: T train=arg\u2061min t{accuracy(t)≥target accuracy}\n\nThis metric ensures that benchmarking focuses on how quickly and effectively a system can achieve meaningful results.\n\nThroughput, often expressed as the number of training samples processed per second, provides an additional measure of system performance: T=N samples T train where N samples is the total number of training samples processed. However, throughput alone does not guarantee meaningful results, as a model may process a large number of samples quickly without necessarily reaching the desired accuracy.\n\nFor example, in MLPerf Training, the benchmark for ResNet-50 may require reaching an accuracy target like 75.9% top-1 on the ImageNet dataset. A system that processes 10,000 images per second but fails to achieve this accuracy is not considered a valid benchmark result, while a system that processes fewer images per second but converges efficiently is preferable. This highlights why throughput must always be evaluated in relation to time-to-accuracy rather than as an independent performance measure.\n\n#### Scalability & Parallelism[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#scalability-parallelism)\n\nAs machine learning models increase in size, training workloads often require distributed computing across multiple processors or accelerators. Scalability measures how effectively training performance improves as more computational resources are added. An ideal system should exhibit near-linear scaling, where doubling the number of GPUs or TPUs leads to a proportional reduction in training time. However, real-world performance is often constrained by factors such as communication overhead, memory bandwidth limitations, and inefficiencies in parallelization strategies.\n\nWhen training large-scale models such as GPT-3, OpenAI employed thousands of GPUs in a distributed training setup. While increasing the number of GPUs provided more raw computational power, the performance improvements were not perfectly linear due to network communication overhead between nodes. Benchmarks such as MLPerf quantify how well a system scales across multiple GPUs, providing insights into where inefficiencies arise in distributed training.\n\nParallelism in training is categorized into data parallelism, model parallelism, and pipeline parallelism, each presenting distinct challenges. Data parallelism, the most commonly used strategy, involves splitting the training dataset across multiple compute nodes. The efficiency of this approach depends on synchronization mechanisms and gradient communication overhead. In contrast, model parallelism partitions the neural network itself, requiring efficient coordination between processors. Benchmarks evaluate how well a system manages these parallelism strategies without degrading accuracy convergence.\n\n#### Resource Utilization[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#resource-utilization)\n\nThe efficiency of machine learning training depends not only on speed and scalability but also on how well available hardware resources are utilized. Compute utilization measures the extent to which processing units, such as GPUs or TPUs, are actively engaged during training. Low utilization may indicate bottlenecks in data movement, memory access, or inefficient workload scheduling.\n\nFor instance, when training BERT on a TPU cluster, researchers observed that input pipeline inefficiencies were limiting overall throughput. Although the TPUs had high raw compute power, the system was not keeping them fully utilized due to slow data retrieval from storage. By profiling the resource utilization, engineers identified the bottleneck and optimized the input pipeline using TFRecord and data prefetching, leading to improved performance.\n\nMemory bandwidth is another critical factor, as deep learning models require frequent access to large volumes of data during training. If memory bandwidth becomes a limiting factor, increasing compute power alone will not improve training speed. Benchmarks assess how well models leverage available memory, ensuring that data transfer rates between storage, main memory, and processing units do not become performance bottlenecks.\n\nI/O performance also plays a significant role in training efficiency, particularly when working with large datasets that cannot fit entirely in memory. Benchmarks evaluate the efficiency of data loading pipelines, including preprocessing operations, caching mechanisms, and storage retrieval speeds. Systems that fail to optimize data loading can experience significant slowdowns, regardless of computational power.\n\n#### Energy Efficiency & Cost[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#energy-efficiency-cost)\n\nTraining large-scale machine learning models requires substantial computational resources, leading to significant energy consumption and financial costs. Energy efficiency metrics quantify the power usage of training workloads, helping identify systems that optimize computational efficiency while minimizing energy waste. The increasing focus on sustainability has led to the inclusion of energy-based benchmarks, such as those in MLPerf Training, which measure power consumption per training run.\n\nTraining GPT-3 was estimated to consume 1,287 MWh of electricity, which is comparable to the yearly energy usage of 100 US households. If a system can achieve the same accuracy with fewer training iterations, it directly reduces energy consumption. Energy-aware benchmarks help guide the development of hardware and training strategies that optimize power efficiency while maintaining accuracy targets.\n\nCost considerations extend beyond electricity usage to include hardware expenses, cloud computing costs, and infrastructure maintenance. Training benchmarks provide insights into the cost-effectiveness of different hardware and software configurations by measuring training time in relation to resource expenditure. Organizations can use these benchmarks to balance performance and budget constraints when selecting training infrastructure.\n\n#### Fault Tolerance & Robustness[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fault-tolerance-robustness)\n\nTraining workloads often run for extended periods, sometimes spanning days or weeks, making fault tolerance an essential consideration. A robust system must be capable of handling unexpected failures, including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and memory errors, without compromising accuracy convergence.\n\nIn large-scale cloud-based training, node failures are common due to hardware instability. If a GPU node in a distributed cluster fails, training must continue without corrupting the model. MLPerf Training includes evaluations of fault-tolerant training strategies, such as checkpointing, where models periodically save their progress. This ensures that failures do not require restarting the entire training process.\n\n#### Reproducibility & Standardization[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#reproducibility-standardization)\n\nFor benchmarks to be meaningful, results must be reproducible across different runs, hardware platforms, and software frameworks. Variability in training results can arise due to stochastic processes, hardware differences, and software optimizations. Ensuring reproducibility requires standardizing evaluation protocols, controlling for randomness in model initialization, and enforcing consistency in dataset processing.\n\nMLPerf Training enforces strict reproducibility requirements, ensuring that accuracy results remain stable across multiple training runs. When NVIDIA submitted benchmark results for MLPerf, they had to demonstrate that their ResNet-50 ImageNet training time remained consistent across different GPUs. This ensures that benchmarks measure true system performance rather than noise from randomness.\n\n### 12.6.3 Training Performance Evaluation[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#training-performance-evaluation)\n\nEvaluating the performance of machine learning training systems involves more than just measuring how fast a model can be trained. A comprehensive benchmarking approach considers multiple dimensions—each capturing a different aspect of system behavior. The specific metrics used depend on the goals of the evaluation, whether those are optimizing speed, improving resource efficiency, reducing energy consumption, or ensuring robustness and reproducibility.\n\n[Table 12.2](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#tbl-training-metrics) provides an overview of the core categories and associated metrics commonly used to benchmark system-level training performance. These categories serve as a framework for understanding how training systems behave under different workloads and configurations.\n\n Table 12.2: Training benchmark metrics and evaluation dimensions. \n\n| Category | Key Metrics | Example Benchmark Use |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Training Time and Throughput | Time-to-accuracy (seconds, minutes, hours); Throughput (samples/sec) | Comparing training speed across different GPU architectures |\n| Scalability and Parallelism | Scaling efficiency (% of ideal speedup); Communication overhead (latency, bandwidth) | Analyzing distributed training performance for large models |\n| Resource Utilization | Compute utilization (% GPU/TPU usage); Memory bandwidth (GB/s); I/O efficiency (data loading speed) | Optimizing data pipelines to improve GPU utilization |\n| Energy Efficiency and Cost | Energy consumption per run (MWh, kWh); Performance per watt (TOPS/W) | Evaluating energy-efficient training strategies |\n| Fault Tolerance and Robustness | Checkpoint overhead (time per save); Recovery success rate (%) | Assessing failure recovery in cloud-based training systems |\n| Reproducibility and Standardization | Variance across runs (% difference in accuracy, training time); Framework consistency (TensorFlow vs.PyTorch vs.JAX) | Ensuring consistency in benchmark results across hardware |\n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#tbl-training-metrics)\n\nTraining time and throughput are often the first metrics considered when evaluating system performance. Time-to-accuracy, the duration required for a model to achieve a specified accuracy level, is a practical and widely used benchmark. Throughput, typically measured in samples per second, provides insight into how efficiently data is processed during training. For example, when comparing a ResNet-50 model trained on NVIDIA A100 versus V100 GPUs, the A100 generally offers higher throughput and faster convergence. However, it is important to ensure that increased throughput does not come at the expense of convergence quality, especially when reduced numerical precision (e.g., TF32) is used to speed up computation.\n\nAs model sizes continue to grow, scalability becomes a critical performance dimension. Efficient use of multiple GPUs or TPUs is essential for training large models such as GPT-3 or T5. In this context, scaling efficiency and communication overhead are key metrics. A system might scale linearly up to 64 GPUs, but beyond that, performance gains may taper off due to increased synchronization and communication costs. Benchmarking tools that monitor interconnect bandwidth and gradient aggregation latency can reveal how well a system handles distributed training.\n\nResource utilization complements these measures by examining how effectively a system leverages its compute and memory resources. Metrics such as GPU utilization, memory bandwidth, and data loading efficiency help identify performance bottlenecks. For instance, a BERT pretraining task that exhibits only moderate GPU utilization may be constrained by an underperforming data pipeline. Optimizations like sharding input files or prefetching data into device memory can often resolve these inefficiencies.\n\nIn addition to raw performance, energy efficiency and cost have become increasingly important considerations. Training large models at scale can consume significant power, raising environmental and financial concerns. Metrics such as energy consumed per training run and performance per watt (e.g., TOPS/W) help evaluate the sustainability of different hardware and system configurations. For example, while two systems may reach the same accuracy in the same amount of time, the one that uses significantly less energy may be preferred for long-term deployment.\n\nFault tolerance and robustness address how well a system performs under non-ideal conditions, which are common in real-world deployments. Training jobs frequently encounter hardware failures, preemptions, or network instability. Metrics like checkpoint overhead and recovery success rate provide insight into the resilience of a training system. In practice, checkpointing can introduce non-trivial overhead—for example, pausing training every 30 minutes to write a full checkpoint may reduce overall throughput by 5-10%. Systems must strike a balance between failure recovery and performance impact.\n\nFinally, reproducibility and standardization ensure that benchmark results are consistent, interpretable, and transferable. Even minor differences in software libraries, initialization seeds, or floating-point behavior can affect training outcomes. Comparing the same model across frameworks, such as comparing PyTorch with Automatic Mixed Precision to TensorFlow with XLA, can reveal variation in convergence rates or final accuracy. Reliable benchmarking requires careful control of these variables, along with repeated runs to assess statistical variance.\n\nTogether, these dimensions provide a holistic view of training performance. They help researchers, engineers, and system designers move beyond simplistic comparisons and toward a more nuanced understanding of how machine learning systems behave under realistic conditions. As training workloads continue to scale, such multidimensional evaluation will be essential for guiding hardware choices, software optimizations, and infrastructure design.\n\n#### Training Benchmark Pitfalls[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#training-benchmark-pitfalls)\n\nDespite the availability of well-defined benchmarking methodologies, certain misconceptions and flawed evaluation practices often lead to misleading conclusions. Understanding these pitfalls is important for interpreting benchmark results correctly.\n\n##### Overemphasis on Raw Throughput[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#overemphasis-on-raw-throughput)\n\nA common mistake in training benchmarks is assuming that higher throughput always translates to better training performance. It is possible to artificially increase throughput by using lower numerical precision, reducing synchronization, or even bypassing certain computations. However, these optimizations do not necessarily lead to faster convergence.\n\nFor example, a system using TF32 precision may achieve higher throughput than one using FP32, but if TF32 introduces numerical instability that increases the number of iterations required to reach the target accuracy, the overall training time may be longer. The correct way to evaluate throughput is in relation to time-to-accuracy, ensuring that speed optimizations do not come at the expense of convergence efficiency.\n\n##### Isolated Single-Node Performance[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#isolated-single-node-performance)\n\nBenchmarking training performance on a single node without considering how well it scales in a distributed setting can lead to misleading conclusions. A GPU may demonstrate excellent throughput when used independently, but when deployed across hundreds of nodes, communication overhead and synchronization constraints may diminish these efficiency gains.\n\nFor instance, a system optimized for single-node performance may employ memory optimizations that do not generalize well to multi-node environments. Large-scale models such as GPT-3 require efficient gradient synchronization across multiple nodes, making it essential to assess scalability rather than relying solely on single-node performance metrics.\n\n##### Ignoring Failures & Interference[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#ignoring-failures-interference)\n\nMany benchmarks assume an idealized training environment where hardware failures, memory corruption, network instability, or interference from other processes do not occur. However, real-world training jobs often experience unexpected failures and workload interference that require checkpointing, recovery mechanisms, and resource management.\n\nA system optimized for ideal-case performance but lacking fault tolerance and interference handling may achieve impressive benchmark results under controlled conditions, but frequent failures, inefficient recovery, and resource contention could make it impractical for large-scale deployment. Effective benchmarking should consider checkpointing overhead, failure recovery efficiency, and the impact of interference from other processes rather than assuming perfect execution conditions.\n\n##### Linear Scaling Assumption[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#linear-scaling-assumption)\n\nWhen evaluating distributed training, it is often assumed that increasing the number of GPUs or TPUs will result in proportional speedups. In practice, communication bottlenecks, memory contention, and synchronization overheads lead to diminishing returns as more compute nodes are added.\n\nFor example, training a model across 1,000 GPUs does not necessarily provide 100 times the speed of training on 10 GPUs. At a certain scale, gradient communication costs become a limiting factor, offsetting the benefits of additional parallelism. Proper benchmarking should assess scalability efficiency rather than assuming idealized linear improvements.\n\n##### Ignoring Reproducibility[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#ignoring-reproducibility)\n\nBenchmark results are often reported without verifying their reproducibility across different hardware and software frameworks. Even minor variations in floating-point arithmetic, memory layouts, or optimization strategies can introduce statistical differences in training time and accuracy.\n\nFor example, a benchmark run on TensorFlow with XLA optimizations may exhibit different convergence characteristics compared to the same model trained using PyTorch with Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Proper benchmarking requires evaluating results across multiple frameworks to ensure that software-specific optimizations do not distort performance comparisons.\n\n#### Final Thoughts[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#final-thoughts)\n\nTraining benchmarks provide valuable insights into machine learning system performance, but their interpretation requires careful consideration of real-world constraints. High throughput does not necessarily mean faster training if it compromises accuracy convergence. Similarly, scaling efficiency must be evaluated holistically, taking into account both computational efficiency and communication overhead.\n\nAvoiding common benchmarking pitfalls and employing structured evaluation methodologies allows machine learning practitioners to gain a deeper understanding of how to optimize training workflows, design efficient AI systems, and develop scalable machine learning infrastructure. As models continue to increase in complexity, benchmarking methodologies must evolve to reflect real-world challenges, ensuring that benchmarks remain meaningful and actionable in guiding AI system development.\n\n12.7 Inference Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#inference-benchmarks)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInference benchmarks provide a systematic approach to evaluating the efficiency, latency, and resource demands of the inference phase in machine learning systems. Unlike training, where the focus is on optimizing large-scale computations over extensive datasets, inference involves deploying trained models to make real-time or batch predictions efficiently. These benchmarks help assess how various factors, including model architectures, hardware configurations, quantization techniques, and runtime optimizations, impact inference performance.\n\nAs deep learning models grow in complexity and size, efficient inference becomes a key challenge, particularly for applications requiring real-time decision-making, such as autonomous driving, healthcare diagnostics, and conversational AI. For example, serving large-scale models like [OpenAI’s GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774) involves handling billions of parameters while maintaining low latency. Inference benchmarks enable systematic evaluation of the underlying hardware and software stacks to ensure that models can be deployed efficiently across different environments, from cloud data centers to edge devices.\n\n Definition of ML Inference Benchmarks \n\n**ML Inference Benchmarks** are standardized tools used to evaluate the _performance_, _efficiency_, and _scalability_ of machine learning systems during the _inference phase_. These benchmarks measure key _system-level metrics_, such as _latency_, _throughput_, _energy consumption_, and _memory footprint_. By providing a structured evaluation framework, inference benchmarks enable _fair comparisons_ across _hardware platforms_, _software runtimes_, and _deployment configurations_. They help identify _bottlenecks_ and optimize _inference pipelines_ for _real-time and large-scale machine learning applications_, ensuring that computational resources are utilized effectively.\n\nUnlike training, which is often conducted in large-scale data centers with ample computational resources, inference must be optimized for diverse deployment scenarios, including mobile devices, IoT systems, and embedded processors. Efficient inference depends on multiple factors, such as optimized data pipelines, quantization, pruning, and hardware acceleration. Benchmarks help evaluate how well these optimizations improve real-world deployment performance.\n\nHardware selection plays an important role in inference efficiency. While GPUs and TPUs are widely used for training, inference workloads often require specialized accelerators like NPUs (Neural Processing Units), FPGAs, and dedicated inference chips such as Google’s Edge TPU. Inference benchmarks evaluate the utilization and performance of these hardware components, helping practitioners choose the right configurations for their deployment needs.\n\nScaling inference workloads across cloud servers, edge platforms, mobile devices, and tinyML systems introduces additional challenges. As illustrated in [Figure 12.6](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-power-differentials), there is a significant differential in power consumption among these systems, ranging from microwatts to megawatts. Inference benchmarks evaluate the trade-offs between latency, cost, and energy efficiency, thereby assisting organizations in making informed deployment decisions.\n\n[![Image 7](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking_files/figure-html/fig-power-differentials-1.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking_files/figure-html/fig-power-differentials-1.png "Figure\xa012.6: Energy consumption by system type.")\n\n Figure 12.6: Energy consumption by system type. \n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-power-differentials)\n\nAs with training, we will reference MLPerf Inference throughout this section to illustrate benchmarking principles. MLPerf provides standardized inference tests across different workloads, including image classification, object detection, speech recognition, and language processing. A full discussion of MLPerf’s methodology and structure is presented later in this chapter.\n\n### 12.7.1 Motivation[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#motivation-1)\n\nDeploying machine learning models for inference introduces a unique set of challenges distinct from training. While training optimizes large-scale computation over extensive datasets, inference must deliver predictions efficiently and at scale in real-world environments. Inference benchmarks provide a systematic approach to evaluating system performance, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring that models can operate effectively across diverse deployment scenarios.\n\nUnlike training, which typically runs on dedicated high-performance hardware, inference must adapt to varying constraints. A model deployed in a cloud server might prioritize high-throughput batch processing, while the same model running on a mobile device must operate under strict latency and power constraints. On edge devices with limited compute and memory, optimizations such as quantization and pruning become critical. Benchmarks help assess these trade-offs, ensuring that inference systems maintain the right balance between accuracy, speed, and efficiency across different platforms.\n\nInference benchmarks help answer fundamental questions about model deployment. How quickly can a model generate predictions in real-world conditions? What are the trade-offs between inference speed and accuracy? Can an inference system handle increasing demand while maintaining low latency? By evaluating these factors, benchmarks guide optimizations in both hardware and software to improve overall efficiency ([Reddi et al. 2019](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-reddi2020mlperf)).\n\n Reddi, Vijay Janapa, Christine Cheng, David Kanter, Peter Mattson, Guenther Schmuelling, Carole-Jean Wu, Brian Anderson, et al. 2019. “MLPerf Inference Benchmark.”_arXiv Preprint arXiv:1911.02549_, November, 446–59. [https://doi.org/10.1109/isca45697.2020.00045](https://doi.org/10.1109/isca45697.2020.00045). \n\n#### Importance of Inference Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#importance-of-inference-benchmarks)\n\nInference plays a critical role in AI applications, where performance directly affects usability and cost. Unlike training, which is often performed offline, inference typically operates in real-time or near real-time, making latency a primary concern. A self-driving car processing camera feeds must react within milliseconds, while a voice assistant generating responses should feel instantaneous to users.\n\nDifferent applications impose varying constraints on inference. Some workloads require single-instance inference, where predictions must be made as quickly as possible for each individual input. This is crucial in real-time systems such as robotics, augmented reality, and conversational AI, where even small delays can impact responsiveness. Other workloads, such as large-scale recommendation systems or search engines, process massive batches of queries simultaneously, prioritizing throughput over per-query latency. Benchmarks allow engineers to evaluate both scenarios and ensure models are optimized for their intended use case.\n\nA key difference between training and inference is that inference workloads often run continuously in production, meaning that small inefficiencies can compound over time. Unlike a training job that runs once and completes, an inference system deployed in the cloud may serve millions of queries daily, and a model running on a smartphone must manage battery consumption over extended use. Benchmarks provide a structured way to measure inference efficiency under these real-world constraints, helping developers make informed choices about model optimization, hardware selection, and deployment strategies.\n\n#### Hardware & Software Optimization[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#hardware-software-optimization-1)\n\nEfficient inference depends on both hardware acceleration and software optimizations. While GPUs and TPUs dominate training, inference is more diverse in its hardware needs. A cloud-based AI service might leverage powerful accelerators for large-scale workloads, whereas mobile devices rely on specialized inference chips like NPUs or optimized CPU execution. On embedded systems, where resources are constrained, achieving high performance requires careful memory and compute efficiency. Benchmarks help evaluate how well different hardware platforms handle inference workloads, guiding deployment decisions.\n\nSoftware optimizations are just as important. Frameworks like TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, and TVM apply optimizations such as operator fusion, quantization, and kernel tuning to improve inference speed and reduce computational overhead. These optimizations can make a significant difference, especially in environments with limited resources. Benchmarks allow developers to measure the impact of such techniques on latency, throughput, and power efficiency, ensuring that optimizations translate into real-world improvements without degrading model accuracy.\n\n#### Scalability & Efficiency[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#scalability-efficiency-1)\n\nInference workloads vary significantly in their scaling requirements. A cloud-based AI system handling millions of queries per second must ensure that increasing demand does not cause delays, while a mobile application running a model locally must execute quickly even under power constraints. Unlike training, which is typically performed on a fixed set of high-performance machines, inference must scale dynamically based on usage patterns and available computational resources.\n\nBenchmarks evaluate how inference systems scale under different conditions. They measure how well performance holds up under increasing query loads, whether additional compute resources improve inference speed, and how efficiently models run across different deployment environments. Large-scale inference deployments often involve distributed inference servers, where multiple copies of a model process incoming requests in parallel. Benchmarks assess how efficiently this scaling occurs and whether additional resources lead to meaningful improvements in latency and throughput.\n\nAnother key factor in inference efficiency is cold-start performance—the time it takes for a model to load and begin processing queries. This is especially relevant for applications that do not run inference continuously but instead load models on demand. Benchmarks help determine whether a system can quickly transition from idle to active execution without significant overhead.\n\n#### Cost & Energy Factors[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#cost-energy-factors-1)\n\nBecause inference workloads run continuously, operational cost and energy efficiency are critical factors. Unlike training, where compute costs are incurred once, inference costs accumulate over time as models are deployed in production. Running an inefficient model at scale can significantly increase cloud compute expenses, while an inefficient mobile inference system can drain battery life quickly. Benchmarks provide insights into cost per inference request, helping organizations optimize for both performance and affordability.\n\nEnergy efficiency is also a growing concern, particularly for mobile and edge AI applications. Many inference workloads run on battery-powered devices, where excessive computation can impact usability. A model running on a smartphone, for example, must be optimized to minimize power consumption while maintaining responsiveness. Benchmarks help evaluate inference efficiency per watt, ensuring that models can operate sustainably across different platforms.\n\n#### Fair ML Systems Comparison[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fair-ml-systems-comparison-1)\n\nWith many different hardware platforms and optimization techniques available, standardized benchmarking is essential for fair comparisons. Without well-defined benchmarks, it becomes difficult to determine whether performance gains come from genuine improvements or from optimizations that exploit specific hardware features. Inference benchmarks provide a consistent evaluation methodology, ensuring that comparisons are meaningful and reproducible.\n\nFor example, MLPerf Inference defines rigorous evaluation criteria for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and speech recognition, making it possible to compare different systems under controlled conditions. These standardized tests prevent misleading results caused by differences in dataset preprocessing, proprietary optimizations, or vendor-specific tuning. By enforcing reproducibility, benchmarks allow researchers and engineers to make informed decisions when selecting inference frameworks, hardware accelerators, and optimization techniques.\n\n### 12.7.2 Metrics[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#metrics-1)\n\nEvaluating the performance of inference systems requires a distinct set of metrics from those used for training. While training benchmarks emphasize throughput, scalability, and time-to-accuracy, inference benchmarks must focus on latency, efficiency, and resource utilization in practical deployment settings. These metrics ensure that machine learning models perform well across different environments, from cloud data centers handling millions of requests to mobile and edge devices operating under strict power and memory constraints.\n\nUnlike training, where the primary goal is to optimize learning speed, inference benchmarks evaluate how efficiently a trained model can process inputs and generate predictions at scale. The following sections describe the most important inference benchmarking metrics, explaining their relevance and how they are used to compare different systems.\n\n#### Latency & Tail Latency[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#latency-tail-latency)\n\nLatency is one of the most critical performance metrics for inference, particularly in real-time applications where delays can negatively impact user experience or system safety. Latency refers to the time taken for an inference system to process an input and produce a prediction. While the average latency of a system is useful, it does not capture performance in high-demand scenarios where occasional delays can degrade reliability.\n\nTo account for this, benchmarks often measure tail latency, which reflects the worst-case delays in a system. These are typically reported as the 95th percentile (p95) or 99th percentile (p99) latency, meaning that 95% or 99% of inferences are completed within a given time. For applications such as autonomous driving or real-time trading, maintaining low tail latency is essential to avoid unpredictable delays that could lead to catastrophic outcomes.\n\n#### Throughput & Batch Processing Efficiency[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#throughput-batch-processing-efficiency)\n\nWhile latency measures the speed of individual inference requests, throughput measures how many inference requests a system can process per second. It is typically expressed in queries per second (QPS) or frames per second (FPS) for vision tasks. Some inference systems operate on a single-instance basis, where each input is processed independently as soon as it arrives. Other systems process multiple inputs in parallel using batch inference, which can significantly improve efficiency by leveraging hardware optimizations.\n\nFor example, cloud-based services handling millions of queries per second benefit from batch inference, where large groups of inputs are processed together to maximize computational efficiency. In contrast, applications like robotics, interactive AI, and augmented reality require low-latency single-instance inference, where the system must respond immediately to each new input.\n\nBenchmarks must consider both single-instance and batch throughput to provide a comprehensive understanding of inference performance across different deployment scenarios.\n\n#### Precision & Accuracy Trade-offs[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#precision-accuracy-trade-offs)\n\nOptimizing inference performance often involves reducing numerical precision, which can significantly accelerate computation while reducing memory and energy consumption. However, lower-precision calculations can introduce accuracy degradation, making it essential to benchmark the trade-offs between speed and predictive quality.\n\nInference benchmarks evaluate how well models perform under different numerical settings, such as FP32, FP16, and INT8. Many modern AI accelerators support mixed-precision inference, allowing systems to dynamically adjust numerical representation based on workload requirements. Quantization and pruning techniques further improve efficiency, but their impact on model accuracy varies depending on the task and dataset. Benchmarks help determine whether these optimizations are viable for deployment, ensuring that improvements in efficiency do not come at the cost of unacceptable accuracy loss.\n\n#### Memory Footprint & Model Size[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#memory-footprint-model-size)\n\nBeyond computational optimizations, memory footprint is another critical consideration for inference systems, particularly for devices with limited resources. Efficient inference depends not only on speed but also on memory usage. Unlike training, where large models can be distributed across powerful GPUs or TPUs, inference often requires models to run within strict memory budgets. The total model size determines how much storage is required for deployment, while RAM usage reflects the working memory needed during execution. Some models require large memory bandwidth to efficiently transfer data between processing units, which can become a bottleneck if the hardware lacks sufficient capacity.\n\nInference benchmarks evaluate these factors to ensure that models can be deployed effectively across a range of devices. A model that achieves high accuracy but exceeds memory constraints may be impractical for real-world use. To address this, compression techniques such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation are often applied to reduce model size while maintaining accuracy. Benchmarks help assess whether these optimizations strike the right balance between memory efficiency and predictive performance.\n\n#### Cold-Start & Model Load Time[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#cold-start-model-load-time)\n\nOnce memory requirements are optimized, cold-start performance becomes critical for ensuring inference systems are ready to respond quickly upon deployment. In many deployment scenarios, models are not always kept in memory but instead loaded on demand when needed. This can introduce significant delays, particularly in serverless AI environments, where resources are allocated dynamically based on incoming requests. Cold-start performance measures how quickly a system can transition from idle to active execution, ensuring that inference is available without excessive wait times.\n\nModel load time refers to the duration required to load a trained model into memory before it can process inputs. In some cases, particularly on resource-limited devices, models must be reloaded frequently to free up memory for other applications. The time taken for the first inference request is also an important consideration, as it reflects the total delay users experience when interacting with an AI-powered service. Benchmarks help quantify these delays, ensuring that inference systems can meet real-world responsiveness requirements.\n\n#### Scalability & Dynamic Workload Handling[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#scalability-dynamic-workload-handling)\n\nWhile cold-start latency addresses initial responsiveness, scalability ensures that inference systems can handle fluctuating workloads and concurrent demands over time Inference workloads must scale effectively across different usage patterns. In cloud-based AI services, this means efficiently handling millions of concurrent users, while on mobile or embedded devices, it involves managing multiple AI models running simultaneously without overloading the system.\n\nScalability measures how well inference performance improves when additional computational resources are allocated. In some cases, adding more GPUs or TPUs increases throughput significantly, but in other scenarios, bottlenecks such as memory bandwidth limitations or network latency may limit scaling efficiency. Benchmarks also assess how well a system balances multiple concurrent models in real-world deployment, where different AI-powered features may need to run at the same time without interference.\n\nFor cloud-based AI, benchmarks evaluate how efficiently a system handles fluctuating demand, ensuring that inference servers can dynamically allocate resources without compromising latency. In mobile and embedded AI, efficient multi-model execution is essential for running multiple AI-powered features simultaneously without degrading system performance.\n\n#### Power Consumption & Energy Efficiency[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#power-consumption-energy-efficiency)\n\nSince inference workloads run continuously in production, power consumption and energy efficiency are critical considerations. This is particularly important for mobile and edge devices, where battery life and thermal constraints limit available computational resources. Even in large-scale cloud environments, power efficiency directly impacts operational costs and sustainability goals.\n\nThe energy required for a single inference is often measured in joules per inference, reflecting how efficiently a system processes inputs while minimizing power draw. In cloud-based inference, efficiency is commonly expressed as queries per second per watt (QPS/W) to quantify how well a system balances performance and energy consumption. For mobile AI applications, optimizing inference power consumption extends battery life and allows models to run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Reducing energy use also plays a key role in making large-scale AI systems more environmentally sustainable, ensuring that computational advancements align with energy-conscious deployment strategies. By balancing power consumption with performance, energy-efficient inference systems enable AI to scale sustainably across diverse applications, from data centers to edge devices.\n\n### 12.7.3 Inference Performance Evaluation[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#inference-performance-evaluation)\n\nEvaluating inference performance is a critical step in understanding how well machine learning systems meet the demands of real-world applications. Unlike training, which is typically conducted offline, inference systems must process inputs and generate predictions efficiently across a wide range of deployment scenarios. Metrics such as latency, throughput, memory usage, and energy efficiency provide a structured way to measure system performance and identify areas for improvement.\n\n[Table 12.3](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#tbl-inference-metrics) below summarizes the key metrics used to evaluate inference systems, highlighting their relevance to different contexts. While each metric offers unique insights, it is important to approach inference benchmarking holistically. Trade-offs between metrics, including speed versus accuracy and throughput versus power consumption, are common, and understanding these trade-offs is essential for effective system design.\n\n Table 12.3: Inference benchmark metrics and evaluation dimensions. \n\n| Category | Key Metrics | Example Benchmark Use |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Latency and Tail Latency | Mean latency (ms/request); Tail latency (p95, p99, p99.9) | Evaluating real-time performance for safety-critical AI |\n| Throughput and Efficiency | Queries per second (QPS); Frames per second (FPS); Batch throughput | Comparing large-scale cloud inference systems |\n| Numerical Precision Impact | Accuracy degradation (FP32 vs.INT8); Speedup from reduced precision | Balancing accuracy vs.efficiency in optimized inference |\n| Memory Footprint | Model size (MB/GB); RAM usage (MB); Memory bandwidth utilization | Assessing feasibility for edge and mobile deployments |\n| Cold-Start and Load Time | Model load time (s); First inference latency (s) | Evaluating responsiveness in serverless AI |\n| Scalability | Efficiency under load; Multi-model serving performance | Measuring robustness for dynamic, high-demand systems |\n| Power and Energy Efficiency | Power consumption (Watts); Performance per Watt (QPS/W) | Optimizing energy use for mobile and sustainable AI |\n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#tbl-inference-metrics)\n\n#### Inference Systems Considerations[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#inference-systems-considerations)\n\nInference systems face unique challenges depending on where and how they are deployed. Real-time applications, such as self-driving cars or voice assistants, require low latency to ensure timely responses, while large-scale cloud deployments focus on maximizing throughput to handle millions of queries. Edge devices, on the other hand, are constrained by memory and power, making efficiency critical.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of evaluating inference performance is understanding the trade-offs between metrics. For example, optimizing for high throughput might increase latency, making a system unsuitable for real-time applications. Similarly, reducing numerical precision improves power efficiency and speed but may lead to minor accuracy degradation. A thoughtful evaluation must balance these trade-offs to align with the intended application.\n\nThe deployment environment also plays a significant role in determining evaluation priorities. Cloud-based systems often prioritize scalability and adaptability to dynamic workloads, while mobile and edge systems require careful attention to memory usage and energy efficiency. These differing priorities mean that benchmarks must be tailored to the context of the system’s use, rather than relying on one-size-fits-all evaluations.\n\nUltimately, evaluating inference performance requires a holistic approach. Focusing on a single metric, such as latency or energy efficiency, provides an incomplete picture. Instead, all relevant dimensions must be considered together to ensure that the system meets its functional, resource, and performance goals in a balanced way.\n\n#### Inference Benchmark Pitfalls[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#inference-benchmark-pitfalls)\n\nEven with well-defined metrics, benchmarking inference systems can be challenging. Missteps during the evaluation process often lead to misleading conclusions. Below are common pitfalls that students and practitioners should be aware of when analyzing inference performance.\n\n##### Overemphasis on Average Latency[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#overemphasis-on-average-latency)\n\nWhile average latency provides a baseline measure of response time, it fails to capture how a system performs under peak load. In real-world scenarios, worst-case latency, which is captured through metrics such as p95 or p99 tail latency, can significantly impact system reliability. For instance, a conversational AI system may fail to provide timely responses if occasional latency spikes exceed acceptable thresholds.\n\n##### Ignoring Memory & Energy Constraints[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#ignoring-memory-energy-constraints)\n\nA model with excellent throughput or latency may be unsuitable for mobile or edge deployments if it requires excessive memory or power. For example, an inference system designed for cloud environments might fail to operate efficiently on a battery-powered device. Proper benchmarks must consider memory footprint and energy consumption to ensure practicality across deployment contexts.\n\n##### Ignoring Cold-Start Performance[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#ignoring-cold-start-performance)\n\nIn serverless environments, where models are loaded on demand, cold-start latency is a critical factor. Ignoring the time it takes to initialize a model and process the first request can result in unrealistic expectations for responsiveness. Evaluating both model load time and first-inference latency ensures that systems are designed to meet real-world responsiveness requirements.\n\n##### Isolated Metrics Evaluation[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#isolated-metrics-evaluation)\n\nBenchmarking inference systems often involves balancing competing metrics. For example, maximizing batch throughput might degrade latency, while aggressive quantization could reduce accuracy. Focusing on a single metric without considering its impact on others can lead to incomplete or misleading evaluations. Comprehensive benchmarks must account for these interactions.\n\n##### Linear Scaling Assumption[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#linear-scaling-assumption-1)\n\nInference performance does not always scale proportionally with additional resources. Bottlenecks such as memory bandwidth, thermal limits, or communication overhead can limit the benefits of adding more GPUs or TPUs. Benchmarks that assume linear scaling behavior may overestimate system performance, particularly in distributed deployments.\n\n##### Ignoring Application Requirements[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#ignoring-application-requirements)\n\nGeneric benchmarking results may fail to account for the specific needs of an application. For instance, a benchmark optimized for cloud inference might be irrelevant for edge devices, where energy and memory constraints dominate. Tailoring benchmarks to the deployment context ensures that results are meaningful and actionable.\n\n#### Final Thoughts[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#final-thoughts-1)\n\nInference benchmarks are essential tools for understanding system performance, but their utility depends on careful and holistic evaluation. Metrics like latency, throughput, memory usage, and energy efficiency provide valuable insights, but their importance varies depending on the application and deployment context. Students should approach benchmarking as a process of balancing multiple priorities, rather than optimizing for a single metric.\n\nAvoiding common pitfalls and considering the trade-offs between different metrics allows practitioners to design inference systems that are reliable, efficient, and suitable for real-world deployment. The ultimate goal of benchmarking is to guide system improvements that align with the demands of the intended application.\n\n### 12.7.4 MLPerf Inference Benchmarks[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#mlperf-inference-benchmarks)\n\nThe MLPerf Inference benchmark, developed by [MLCommons](https://mlcommons.org/en/), provides a standardized framework for evaluating machine learning inference performance across a range of deployment environments. Initially, MLPerf started with a single inference benchmark, but as machine learning systems expanded into diverse applications, it became clear that a one-size-fits-all benchmark was insufficient. Different inference scenarios, including cloud-based AI services and resource-constrained embedded devices, demanded tailored evaluations. This realization led to the development of a family of MLPerf inference benchmarks, each designed to assess performance within a specific deployment setting.\n\n#### MLPerf Inference[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#mlperf-inference)\n\n[MLPerf Inference](https://mlcommons.org/en/inference-datacenter/) serves as the baseline benchmark, originally designed to evaluate large-scale inference systems. It primarily focuses on data center and cloud-based inference workloads, where high throughput, low latency, and efficient resource utilization are essential. The benchmark assesses performance across a range of deep learning models, including image classification, object detection, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. This version of MLPerf remains the gold standard for comparing AI accelerators, GPUs, TPUs, and CPUs in high-performance computing environments.\n\n#### MLPerf Mobile[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#mlperf-mobile)\n\n[MLPerf Mobile](https://mlcommons.org/en/mlperf-mobile/) extends MLPerf’s evaluation framework to smartphones and other mobile devices. Unlike cloud-based inference, mobile inference operates under strict power and memory constraints, requiring models to be optimized for efficiency without sacrificing responsiveness. The benchmark measures latency and responsiveness for real-time AI tasks, such as camera-based scene detection, speech recognition, and augmented reality applications. MLPerf Mobile has become an industry standard for assessing AI performance on flagship smartphones and mobile AI chips, helping developers optimize models for on-device AI workloads.\n\n#### MLPerf Client[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#mlperf-client)\n\n[MLPerf Client](https://mlcommons.org/en/inference-edge/) focuses on inference performance on consumer computing devices, such as laptops, desktops, and workstations. This benchmark addresses local AI workloads that run directly on personal devices, eliminating reliance on cloud inference. Tasks such as real-time video editing, speech-to-text transcription, and AI-enhanced productivity applications fall under this category. Unlike cloud-based benchmarks, MLPerf Client evaluates how AI workloads interact with general-purpose hardware, such as CPUs, discrete GPUs, and integrated Neural Processing Units (NPUs), making it relevant for consumer and enterprise AI applications.\n\n#### MLPerf Tiny[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#mlperf-tiny)\n\n[MLPerf Tiny](https://mlcommons.org/en/inference-tiny/) was created to benchmark embedded and ultra-low-power AI systems, such as IoT devices, wearables, and microcontrollers. Unlike other MLPerf benchmarks, which assess performance on powerful accelerators, MLPerf Tiny evaluates inference on devices with limited compute, memory, and power resources. This benchmark is particularly relevant for applications such as smart sensors, AI-driven automation, and real-time industrial monitoring, where models must run efficiently on hardware with minimal processing capabilities. MLPerf Tiny plays a crucial role in the advancement of AI at the edge, helping developers optimize models for constrained environments.\n\n#### Continued Expansion[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#continued-expansion)\n\nThe evolution of MLPerf Inference from a single benchmark to a spectrum of benchmarks reflects the diversity of AI deployment scenarios. Different environments, including cloud, mobile, desktop, and embedded environments, have unique constraints and requirements, and MLPerf provides a structured way to evaluate AI models accordingly.\n\nMLPerf is an essential tool for:\n\n*   Understanding how inference performance varies across deployment settings.\n*   Learning which performance metrics are most relevant for different AI applications.\n*   Optimizing models and hardware choices based on real-world usage constraints.\n\nRecognizing the necessity of tailored inference benchmarks deepens our understanding of AI deployment challenges and highlights the importance of benchmarking in developing efficient, scalable, and practical machine learning systems.\n\n12.8 Energy Efficiency Measurement[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#energy-efficiency-measurement)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs machine learning expands into diverse applications, concerns about its growing power consumption and ecological footprint have intensified. While performance benchmarks help optimize speed and accuracy, they do not always account for energy efficiency, which is an increasingly critical factor in real-world deployment. Efficient inference is particularly important in scenarios where power is a limited resource, such as mobile devices, embedded AI, and cloud-scale inference workloads. The need to optimize both performance and power consumption has led to the development of standardized energy efficiency benchmarks.\n\nHowever, measuring power consumption in machine learning systems presents unique challenges. The energy demands of ML models vary dramatically across deployment environments, as shown in [Table 12.4](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#tbl-power). This wide spectrum, spanning from TinyML devices consuming mere microwatts to data center racks requiring kilowatts, illustrates the fundamental challenge in creating standardized benchmarking methodologies ([Henderson et al. 2020](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-henderson2020towards)).\n\n Henderson, Peter, Jieru Hu, Joshua Romoff, Emma Brunskill, Dan Jurafsky, and Joelle Pineau. 2020. “Towards the Systematic Reporting of the Energy and Carbon Footprints of Machine Learning.”_CoRR_ abs/2002.05651 (248): 1–43. [https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2002.05651](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2002.05651). \n\n Table 12.4: Power consumption across ML deployment scales \n\n| Category | Device Type | Power Consumption |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tiny | Neural Decision Processor (NDP) | 150 µW |\n| Tiny | M7 Microcontroller | 25 mW |\n| Mobile | Raspberry Pi 4 | 3.5 W |\n| Mobile | Smartphone | 4 W |\n| Edge | Smart Camera | 10-15 W |\n| Edge | Edge Server | 65-95 W |\n| Cloud | ML Server Node | 300-500 W |\n| Cloud | ML Server Rack | 4-10 kW |\n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#tbl-power)\n\nThis dramatic range in power requirements, which spans over four orders of magnitude, presents significant challenges for measurement and benchmarking. Creating a unified methodology requires careful consideration of each scale’s unique characteristics. For example, accurately measuring microwatt-level consumption in TinyML devices demands different instrumentation and techniques than monitoring kilowatt-scale server racks. Any comprehensive benchmarking framework must accommodate these vastly different scales while ensuring measurements remain consistent, fair, and reproducible across diverse hardware configurations.\n\n### 12.8.1 Power Measurement Boundaries[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#power-measurement-boundaries)\n\n[Figure 12.7](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-power-diagram) illustrates how power consumption is measured at different system scales, from TinyML devices to full-scale data center inference nodes. Each scenario highlights distinct measurement boundaries, shown in green, which indicate the components included in energy accounting. Components outside these boundaries, shown with red dashed outlines, are excluded from power measurements.\n\n[![Image 8](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/power_component_diagram.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/power_component_diagram.png "Figure\xa012.7: MLPerf Power system measurement diagram. Source: @tschand2024mlperf.")\n\n Figure 12.7: MLPerf Power system measurement diagram. Source: Tschand et al. ([2024](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-tschand2024mlperf)). \n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-power-diagram)\n\nThe diagram is organized into three categories, Tiny, Inference, and Training examples, each reflecting different measurement scopes based on system architecture and deployment environment. In TinyML systems, the entire low-power SoC, including compute, memory, and basic interconnects, typically falls within the measurement boundary. Inference nodes introduce more complexity, incorporating multiple SoCs, local storage, accelerators, and memory, while often excluding remote storage and off-chip components. Training deployments span multiple racks, where only selected elements, including compute nodes and network switches, are measured, while storage systems, cooling infrastructure, and parts of the interconnect fabric are often excluded.\n\nSystem-level power measurement offers a more holistic view than measuring individual components in isolation. While component-level metrics (e.g., accelerator or processor power) are valuable for performance tuning, real-world ML workloads involve intricate interactions between compute units, memory systems, and supporting infrastructure. For instance, memory-bound inference tasks can consume up to 60% of total system power on data movement alone.\n\nShared infrastructure presents additional challenges. In data centers, resources such as cooling systems and power delivery are shared across workloads, complicating attribution of energy use to specific ML tasks. Cooling alone can account for 20-30% of total facility power consumption, making it a major factor in energy efficiency assessments ([Barroso, Clidaras, and Hölzle 2013](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-barroso2022datacenter)). Even at the edge, components like memory and I/O interfaces may serve both ML and non-ML functions, further blurring measurement boundaries.\n\n Barroso, Luiz André, Jimmy Clidaras, and Urs Hölzle. 2013. _The Datacenter as a Computer: An Introduction to the Design of Warehouse-Scale Machines_. Springer International Publishing. [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-01741-4](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-01741-4). \n\nModern hardware also introduces variability through dynamic power management. Features like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) can cause power consumption to vary by 30-50% for the same ML model, depending on system load and concurrent activity.\n\nFinally, support infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on cooling, has a significant impact on total energy use in large-scale deployments. Data centers must maintain operational temperatures, typically between 20-25°C, to ensure system reliability. Cooling overhead is captured in the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which ranges from 1.1 in highly efficient facilities to over 2.0 in less optimized ones ([Barroso, Hölzle, and Ranganathan 2019](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-barroso2019datacenter)). Even edge devices require basic thermal management, with cooling accounting for 5-10% of overall power consumption.\n\n Barroso, Luiz André, Urs Hölzle, and Parthasarathy Ranganathan. 2019. _The Datacenter as a Computer: Designing Warehouse-Scale Machines_. Springer International Publishing. [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-01761-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-01761-2). \n\n### 12.8.2 Performance vs Energy Efficiency[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#performance-vs-energy-efficiency)\n\nA critical consideration in ML system design is the relationship between performance and energy efficiency. Maximizing raw performance often leads to diminishing returns in energy efficiency. For example, increasing processor frequency by 20% might yield only a 5% performance improvement while increasing power consumption by 50%. This non-linear relationship means that the most energy-efficient operating point is often not the highest performing one.\n\nIn many deployment scenarios, particularly in battery-powered devices, finding the optimal balance between performance and energy efficiency is crucial. For instance, reducing model precision from FP32 to INT8 might reduce accuracy by 1-2% but can improve energy efficiency by 3-4x. Similarly, batch processing can improve throughput efficiency at the cost of increased latency.\n\nThese tradeoffs span three key dimensions: accuracy, performance, and energy efficiency. Model quantization illustrates this relationship clearly, reducing numerical precision from FP32 to INT8 typically results in a small accuracy drop (1-2%), but it can improve both inference speed and energy efficiency by 3-4x. Similarly, techniques like pruning and model compression require carefully balancing accuracy losses against efficiency gains. Finding the optimal operating point among these three factors depends heavily on deployment requirements; mobile applications might prioritize energy efficiency, while cloud services might optimize for accuracy at the cost of higher power consumption.\n\nAs benchmarking methodologies continue to evolve, energy efficiency metrics will play an increasingly central role in AI optimization. Future advancements in sustainable AI benchmarking will help researchers and engineers design systems that balance performance, power consumption, and environmental impact, ensuring that ML systems operate efficiently without unnecessary energy waste.\n\n### 12.8.3 Standardized Power Measurement[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#standardized-power-measurement)\n\nWhile power measurement techniques, such as [SPEC Power](https://www.spec.org/power/), have long existed for general computing systems ([Lange 2009](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-lange2009identifying)), machine learning workloads present unique challenges that require specialized measurement approaches. Machine learnign systems exhibit distinct power consumption patterns characterized by phases of intense computation interspersed with data movement and preprocessing operations. These patterns vary significantly across different types of models and tasks. A large language model’s power profile looks very different from that of a computer vision inference task.\n\n Lange, Klaus-Dieter. 2009. “Identifying Shades of Green: The SPECpower Benchmarks.”_Computer_ 42 (3): 95–97. [https://doi.org/10.1109/mc.2009.84](https://doi.org/10.1109/mc.2009.84). \n\nDirect power measurement requires careful consideration of sampling rates and measurement windows. For example, transformer model inference creates short, intense power spikes during attention computations, requiring high-frequency sampling (> 1 KHz) to capture accurately. In contrast, CNN inference tends to show more consistent power draw patterns that can be captured with lower sampling rates. The measurement duration must also account for ML-specific behaviors like warm-up periods, where initial inferences may consume more power due to cache population and pipeline initialization.\n\nMemory access patterns in ML workloads significantly impact power consumption measurements. While traditional compute benchmarks might focus primarily on processor power, ML systems often spend substantial energy moving data between memory hierarchies. For example, recommendation models like DLRM can spend more energy on memory access than computation. This requires measurement approaches that can capture both compute and memory subsystem power consumption.\n\nAccelerator-specific considerations further complicate power measurement. Many ML systems employ specialized hardware like GPUs, TPUs, or NPUs. These accelerators often have their own power management schemes and can operate independently of the main system processor. Accurate measurement requires capturing power consumption across all relevant compute units while maintaining proper time synchronization. This is particularly challenging in heterogeneous systems that may dynamically switch between different compute resources based on workload characteristics or power constraints.\n\nThe scale and distribution of ML workloads also influences measurement methodology. In distributed training scenarios, power measurement must account for both local compute power and the energy cost of gradient synchronization across nodes. Similarly, edge ML deployments must consider both active inference power and the energy cost of model updates or data preprocessing.\n\nBatch size and throughput considerations add another layer of complexity. Unlike traditional computing workloads, ML systems often process inputs in batches to improve computational efficiency. However, the relationship between batch size and power consumption is non-linear. While larger batches generally improve compute efficiency, they also increase memory pressure and peak power requirements. Measurement methodologies must therefore capture power consumption across different batch sizes to provide a complete efficiency profile.\n\nSystem idle states require special attention in ML workloads, particularly in edge scenarios where systems operate intermittently, actively processing when new data arrives, then entering low-power states between inferences. A wake-word detection Tiny ML system, for instance, might only actively process audio for a small fraction of its operating time, making idle power consumption a critical factor in overall efficiency.\n\nTemperature effects play a crucial role in ML system power measurement. Sustained ML workloads can cause significant temperature increases, triggering thermal throttling and changing power consumption patterns. This is especially relevant in edge devices where thermal constraints may limit sustained performance. Measurement methodologies must account for these thermal effects and their impact on power consumption, particularly during extended benchmarking runs.\n\n### 12.8.4 MLPerf Power Case Study[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#mlperf-power-case-study)\n\nMLPerf Power ([Tschand et al. 2024](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-tschand2024mlperf)) is a standard methodolgy for measuring energy efficiency in machine learning systems. This comprehensive benchmarking framework provides accurate assessment of power consumption across diverse ML deployments. At the datacenter level, it measures power usage in large-scale AI workloads, where energy consumption optimization directly impacts operational costs. For edge computing, it evaluates power efficiency in consumer devices like smartphones and laptops, where battery life constraints are paramount. In tiny inference scenarios, it assesses energy consumption for ultra-low-power AI systems, particularly IoT sensors and microcontrollers operating with strict power budgets.\n\nThe MLPerf Power methodology relies on standardized measurement protocols that adapt to various hardware architectures, ranging from general-purpose CPUs to specialized AI accelerators. This standardization ensures meaningful cross-platform comparisons while maintaining measurement integrity across different computing scales.\n\nThe benchmark has accumulated thousands of reproducible measurements submitted by industry organizations, which demonstrates their latest hardware capabilities and the sector-wide focus on energy-efficient AI technology. [Figure 12.8](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-power-trends) illustrates the evolution of energy efficiency across system scales through successive MLPerf versions.\n\nThe MLPerf Power methodology adapts to different hardware architectures, ranging from general-purpose CPUs to specialized AI accelerators, while maintaining a uniform measurement standard. This ensures that comparisons across platforms are meaningful and unbiased.\n\nAcross the versions and ML deployment scales of the MLPerf benchmark suite, industry organizations have submitted reproducible measurements on their most recent hardware to observe and quantify the industry-wide emphasis on optimizing AI technology for energy efficiency. [Figure 12.8](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-power-trends) shows the trends in energy efficiency from tiny to datacenter scale systems across MLPerf versions.\n\n[![Image 9](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/power_trends.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/power_trends.png "Figure\xa012.8: Comparison of energy efficiency trends for MLPerf Power datacenter, edge, and tiny inference submissions across versions.

([2024](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-tschand2024mlperf)). \n\n Tschand, Arya, Arun Tejusve Raghunath Rajan, Sachin Idgunji, Anirban Ghosh, Jeremy Holleman, Csaba Kiraly, Pawan Ambalkar, et al. 2024. “MLPerf Power: Benchmarking the Energy Efficiency of Machine Learning Systems from Microwatts to Megawatts for Sustainable AI.”_arXiv Preprint arXiv:2410.12032_, October. [http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12032v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12032v2). \n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-power-trends)\n\nAnalysis of these trends reveals two significant patterns: first, a plateauing of energy efficiency improvements across all three scales for traditional ML workloads, and second, a dramatic increase in energy efficiency specifically for generative AI applications. This dichotomy suggests both the maturation of optimization techniques for conventional ML tasks and the rapid innovation occurring in the generative AI space. These trends underscore the dual challenges facing the field: developing novel approaches to break through efficiency plateaus while ensuring sustainable scaling practices for increasingly powerful generative AI models.\n\n12.9 Challenges & Limitations[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#challenges-limitations)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBenchmarking provides a structured framework for evaluating the performance of AI systems, but it comes with significant challenges. If these challenges are not properly addressed, they can undermine the credibility and usefulness of benchmarking results. One of the most fundamental issues is incomplete problem coverage. Many benchmarks, while useful for controlled comparisons, fail to capture the full diversity of real-world applications. For instance, common image classification datasets, such as [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), contain a limited variety of images. As a result, models that perform well on these datasets may struggle when applied to more complex, real-world scenarios with greater variability in lighting, perspective, and object composition.\n\nAnother challenge is statistical insignificance, which arises when benchmark evaluations are conducted on too few data samples or trials. For example, testing an optical character recognition (OCR) system on a small dataset may not accurately reflect its performance on large-scale, noisy text documents. Without sufficient trials and diverse input distributions, benchmarking results may be misleading or fail to capture true system reliability.\n\nReproducibility is also a major concern. Benchmark results can vary significantly depending on factors such as hardware configurations, software versions, and system dependencies. Small differences in compilers, numerical precision, or library updates can lead to inconsistent performance measurements across different environments. To mitigate this issue, MLPerf addresses reproducibility by providing reference implementations, standardized test environments, and strict submission guidelines. Even with these efforts, achieving true consistency across diverse hardware platforms remains an ongoing challenge.\n\nA more fundamental limitation of benchmarking is the risk of misalignment with real-world goals. Many benchmarks emphasize metrics such as speed, accuracy, and throughput, but practical AI deployments often require balancing multiple objectives, including power efficiency, cost, and robustness. A model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a benchmark may be impractical for deployment if it consumes excessive energy or requires expensive hardware. Furthermore, benchmarks can quickly become outdated due to the rapid evolution of AI models and hardware. New techniques may emerge that render existing benchmarks less relevant, necessitating continuous updates to keep benchmarking methodologies aligned with state-of-the-art developments.\n\nWhile these challenges affect all benchmarking efforts, the most pressing concern is the role of benchmark engineering, which introduces the risk of over-optimization for specific benchmark tasks rather than meaningful improvements in real-world performance.\n\n### 12.9.1 Environmental Conditions[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#environmental-conditions)\n\nEnvironmental conditions in AI benchmarking refer to the physical and operational circumstances under which experiments are conducted. These conditions, while often overlooked, can significantly influence benchmark results and impact the reproducibility of experiments. Physical environmental factors include ambient temperature, humidity, air quality, and altitude. These elements can affect hardware performance in subtle but measurable ways. For instance, elevated temperatures may lead to thermal throttling in processors, potentially reducing computational speed and affecting benchmark outcomes. Similarly, variations in altitude can impact cooling system efficiency and hard drive performance due to changes in air pressure.\n\nOperational environmental factors encompass the broader system context in which benchmarks are executed. This includes background processes running on the system, network conditions, and power supply stability. The presence of other active programs or services can compete for computational resources, potentially altering the performance characteristics of the model under evaluation. To ensure the validity and reproducibility of benchmark results, it is essential to document and control these environmental conditions to the extent possible. This may involve conducting experiments in temperature-controlled environments, monitoring and reporting ambient conditions, standardizing the operational state of benchmark systems, and documenting any background processes or system loads.\n\nIn scenarios where controlling all environmental variables is impractical, such as in distributed or cloud-based benchmarking, it becomes essential to report these conditions in detail. This information allows other researchers to account for potential variations when interpreting or attempting to reproduce results. As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in diverse real-world environments, understanding the impact of environmental conditions on model performance becomes even more critical. This knowledge not only ensures more accurate benchmarking but also informs the development of robust models capable of consistent performance across varying operational conditions.\n\n### 12.9.2 Hardware Lottery[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#hardware-lottery)\n\nA critical issue in benchmarking is what has been described as the hardware lottery, a concept introduced by ([Ahmed et al. 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-hooker2021hardware)). The success of a machine learning model is often dictated not only by its architecture and training data but also by how well it aligns with the underlying hardware used for inference. Some models perform exceptionally well, not because they are inherently better, but because they are optimized for the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs or TPUs. Meanwhile, other promising architectures may be overlooked because they do not map efficiently to dominant hardware platforms.\n\n Ahmed, Reyan, Greg Bodwin, Keaton Hamm, Stephen Kobourov, and Richard Spence. 2021. “On Additive Spanners in Weighted Graphs with Local Error.”_arXiv Preprint arXiv:2103.09731_ 64 (12): 58–65. [https://doi.org/10.1145/3467017](https://doi.org/10.1145/3467017). \n\nThis dependence on hardware compatibility introduces biases into benchmarking. A model that is highly efficient on a specific GPU may perform poorly on a CPU or a custom AI accelerator. For instance, [Figure 12.9](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-hw-lottery) compares the performance of models across different hardware platforms. The multi-hardware models show comparable results to “MobileNetV3 Large min” on both the CPU `uint8` and GPU configurations. However, these multi-hardware models demonstrate significant performance improvements over the MobileNetV3 Large baseline when run on the EdgeTPU and DSP hardware. This emphasizes the variable efficiency of multi-hardware models in specialized computing environments.\n\n[![Image 10](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/hardware_lottery.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/hardware_lottery.png "Figure\xa012.9: Accuracy-latency trade-offs of multiple ML models and how they perform on various hardware. Source: @chu2021discovering.")\n\n Figure 12.9: Accuracy-latency trade-offs of multiple ML models and how they perform on various hardware. Source: Chu et al. ([2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-chu2021discovering)). \n\n Chu, Grace, Okan Arikan, Gabriel Bender, Weijun Wang, Achille Brighton, Pieter-Jan Kindermans, Hanxiao Liu, Berkin Akin, Suyog Gupta, and Andrew Howard. 2021. “Discovering Multi-Hardware Mobile Models via Architecture Search.” In _2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)_, 34:3016–25. IEEE. [https://doi.org/10.1109/cvprw53098.2021.00337](https://doi.org/10.1109/cvprw53098.2021.00337). \n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-hw-lottery)\n\nWithout careful benchmarking across diverse hardware configurations, the field risks favoring architectures that “win” the hardware lottery rather than selecting models based on their intrinsic strengths. This bias can shape research directions, influence funding allocation, and impact the design of next-generation AI systems. In extreme cases, it may even stifle innovation by discouraging exploration of alternative architectures that do not align with current hardware trends.\n\n### 12.9.3 Benchmark Engineering[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#benchmark-engineering)\n\nWhile the hardware lottery is an unintended consequence of hardware trends, benchmark engineering is an intentional practice where models or systems are explicitly optimized to excel on specific benchmark tests. This practice can lead to misleading performance claims and results that do not generalize beyond the benchmarking environment.\n\nBenchmark engineering occurs when AI developers fine-tune hyperparameters, preprocessing techniques, or model architectures specifically to maximize benchmark scores rather than improve real-world performance. For example, an object detection model might be carefully optimized to achieve record-low latency on a benchmark but fail when deployed in dynamic, real-world environments with varying lighting, motion blur, and occlusions. Similarly, a language model might be tuned to excel on benchmark datasets but struggle when processing conversational speech with informal phrasing and code-switching.\n\nThe pressure to achieve high benchmark scores is often driven by competition, marketing, and research recognition. Benchmarks are frequently used to rank AI models and systems, creating an incentive to optimize specifically for them. While this can drive technical advancements, it also risks prioritizing benchmark-specific optimizations at the expense of broader generalization.\n\n### 12.9.4 Bias & Over-Optimization[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#bias-over-optimization)\n\nTo ensure that benchmarks remain useful and fair, several strategies can be employed. Transparency is one of the most important factors in maintaining benchmarking integrity. Benchmark submissions should include detailed documentation on any optimizations applied, ensuring that improvements are clearly distinguished from benchmark-specific tuning. Researchers and developers should report both benchmark performance and real-world deployment results to provide a complete picture of a system’s capabilities.\n\nAnother approach is to diversify and evolve benchmarking methodologies. Instead of relying on a single static benchmark, AI systems should be evaluated across multiple, continuously updated benchmarks that reflect real-world complexity. This reduces the risk of models being overfitted to a single test set and encourages general-purpose improvements rather than narrow optimizations.\n\nStandardization and third-party verification can also help mitigate bias. By establishing industry-wide benchmarking standards and requiring independent third-party audits of results, the AI community can improve the reliability and credibility of benchmarking outcomes. Third-party verification ensures that reported results are reproducible across different settings and helps prevent unintentional benchmark gaming.\n\nAnother important strategy is application-specific testing. While benchmarks provide controlled evaluations, real-world deployment testing remains essential. AI models should be assessed not only on benchmark datasets but also in practical deployment environments. For instance, an autonomous driving model should be tested in a variety of weather conditions and urban settings rather than being judged solely on controlled benchmark datasets.\n\nFinally, fairness across hardware platforms must be considered. Benchmarks should test AI models on multiple hardware configurations to ensure that performance is not being driven solely by compatibility with a specific platform. This helps reduce the risk of the hardware lottery and provides a more balanced evaluation of AI system efficiency.\n\n### 12.9.5 Benchmark Evolution[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#benchmark-evolution)\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in benchmarking is that benchmarks are never static. As AI systems evolve, so must the benchmarks that evaluate them. What defines “good performance” today may be irrelevant tomorrow as models, hardware, and application requirements change. While benchmarks are essential for tracking progress, they can also quickly become outdated, leading to over-optimization for old metrics rather than real-world performance improvements.\n\nThis evolution is evident in the history of AI benchmarks. Early model benchmarks, for instance, focused heavily on image classification and object detection, as these were some of the first widely studied deep learning tasks. However, as AI expanded into natural language processing, recommendation systems, and generative AI, it became clear that these early benchmarks no longer reflected the most important challenges in the field. In response, new benchmarks emerged to measure language understanding ([Wang et al. 2018](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-wang2018glue), [2019](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-wang2019superglue)) and generative AI ([Liang et al. 2022](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-liang2022helm)).\n\n Wang, Alex, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R.

While traditional AI benchmarks emphasized accuracy and throughput, modern applications demand evaluation across multiple criteria: fairness, robustness, scalability, and energy efficiency. [Figure 12.10](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-sciml-graph) illustrates this complexity through scientific applications, which span orders of magnitude in their performance requirements. For instance, Large Hadron Collider sensors must process data at rates approaching 10 14 bytes per second with nanosecond-scale computation times, while mobile applications operate at 10 4 bytes per second with longer computational windows. This range of requirements necessitates specialized benchmarks—for example, edge AI applications require benchmarks like MLPerf that specifically evaluate performance under resource constraints and scientific application domains need their own “Fast ML for Science” benchmarks ([Duarte et al. 2022a](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-duarte2022fastml)).\n\n[![Image 11](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/sciml_graph.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/sciml_graph.png "Figure\xa012.10: Data rate and computation time requirements of emerging scientific applications.

On the one hand, benchmarks must remain stable for long enough to allow meaningful comparisons over time. If benchmarks change too frequently, it becomes difficult to track long-term progress and compare new results with historical performance. On the other hand, failing to update benchmarks leads to stagnation, where models are optimized for outdated tasks rather than advancing the field. Striking the right balance between benchmark longevity and adaptation is an ongoing challenge for the AI community.\n\nDespite these difficulties, evolving benchmarks is essential for ensuring that AI progress remains meaningful. Without updates, benchmarks risk becoming detached from real-world needs, leading researchers and engineers to focus on optimizing models for artificial test cases rather than solving practical challenges. As AI continues to expand into new domains, benchmarking must keep pace, ensuring that performance evaluations remain relevant, fair, and aligned with real-world deployment scenarios.\n\n### 12.9.6 MLPerf’s Role[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#mlperfs-role)\n\nMLPerf has played a crucial role in improving benchmarking by reducing bias, increasing generalizability, and ensuring benchmarks evolve alongside AI advancements. One of its key contributions is the standardization of benchmarking environments. By providing reference implementations, clearly defined rules, and reproducible test environments, MLPerf ensures that performance results are consistent across different hardware and software platforms, reducing variability in benchmarking outcomes.\n\nRecognizing that AI is deployed in a variety of real-world settings, MLPerf has also introduced different categories of inference benchmarks. The inclusion of MLPerf Inference, MLPerf Mobile, MLPerf Client, and MLPerf Tiny reflects an effort to evaluate models in the contexts where they will actually be deployed. This approach mitigates issues such as the hardware lottery by ensuring that AI systems are tested across diverse computational environments, rather than being over-optimized for a single hardware type.\n\nBeyond providing a structured benchmarking framework, MLPerf is continuously evolving to keep pace with the rapid progress in AI. New tasks are incorporated into benchmarks to reflect emerging challenges, such as generative AI models and energy-efficient computing, ensuring that evaluations remain relevant and forward-looking. By regularly updating its benchmarking methodologies, MLPerf helps prevent benchmarks from becoming outdated or encouraging overfitting to legacy performance metrics.\n\nBy prioritizing fairness, transparency, and adaptability, MLPerf ensures that benchmarking remains a meaningful tool for guiding AI research and deployment. Instead of simply measuring raw speed or accuracy, MLPerf’s evolving benchmarks aim to capture the complexities of real-world AI performance, ultimately fostering more reliable, efficient, and impactful AI systems.\n\n12.10 Beyond System Benchmarking[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#beyond-system-benchmarking)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile this chapter has primarily focused on system benchmarking, AI performance is not determined by system efficiency alone. Machine learning models and datasets play an equally crucial role in shaping AI capabilities. Model benchmarking evaluates algorithmic performance, while data benchmarking ensures that training datasets are high-quality, unbiased, and representative of real-world distributions. Understanding these aspects is vital because AI systems are not just computational pipelines—they are deeply dependent on the models they execute and the data they are trained on.\n\n### 12.10.1 Model Benchmarking[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#model-benchmarking)\n\nModel benchmarks measure how well different machine learning algorithms perform on specific tasks. Historically, benchmarks focused almost exclusively on accuracy, but as models have grown more complex, additional factors, including fairness, robustness, efficiency, and generalizability, have become equally important.\n\nThe evolution of machine learning has been largely driven by benchmark datasets. The MNIST dataset ([Lecun et al. 1998](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-lecun1998gradient)) was one of the earliest catalysts, advancing handwritten digit recognition, while the ImageNet dataset ([Deng et al. 2009](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-deng2009imagenet)) sparked the deep learning revolution in image classification. More recently, datasets like COCO ([Lin et al. 2014](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-lin2014microsoft)) for object detection and GPT-3’s training corpus ([Brown et al. 2020](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-brown2020language)) have pushed the boundaries of model capabilities even further.\n\n Lecun, Y., L.

[http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18824v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18824v1). \n\nHowever, model benchmarks face significant limitations, particularly in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). Beyond the traditional challenge of models failing in real-world conditions, commonly referred to as the Sim2Real gap, a new form of benchmark optimization has emerged, analogous to but distinct from classical benchmark engineering in computer systems. In traditional systems evaluation, developers would explicitly optimize their code implementations to perform well on benchmark suites like SPEC or TPC, which we discussed earlier under “Benchmark Engineering”. In the case of LLMs, this phenomenon manifests through data rather than code: benchmark datasets may become embedded in training data, either inadvertently through web-scale training or deliberately through dataset curation ([Xu et al. 2024](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-xu2024benchmarking)). This creates fundamental challenges for model evaluation, as high performance on benchmark tasks may reflect memorization rather than genuine capability. The key distinction lies in the mechanism: while systems benchmark engineering occurred through explicit code optimization, LLM benchmark adaptation can occur implicitly through data exposure during pre-training, raising new questions about the validity of current evaluation methodologies.\n\nThese challenges extend beyond just LLMs. Traditional machine learning systems continue to struggle with problems of overfitting and bias. The Gender Shades project ([Buolamwini and Gebru 2018](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-buolamwini2018gender)), for instance, revealed that commercial facial recognition models performed significantly worse on darker-skinned individuals, highlighting the critical importance of fairness in model evaluation. Such findings underscore the limitations of focusing solely on aggregate accuracy metrics.\n\n Buolamwini, Joy, and Timnit Gebru. 2018. “Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification.” In _Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency_, 77–91. PMLR. [http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html). \n\nMoving forward, we must fundamentally rethink its approach to benchmarking. This evolution requires developing evaluation frameworks that go beyond traditional metrics to assess multiple dimensions of model behavior—from generalization and robustness to fairness and efficiency. Key challenges include creating benchmarks that remain relevant as models advance, developing methodologies that can differentiate between genuine capabilities and artificial performance gains, and establishing standards for benchmark documentation and transparency. Success in these areas will help ensure that benchmark results provide meaningful insights about model capabilities rather than reflecting artifacts of training procedures or evaluation design.\n\n### 12.10.2 Data Benchmarking[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#data-benchmarking)\n\nThe evolution of artificial intelligence has traditionally focused on model-centric approaches, emphasizing architectural improvements and optimization techniques. However, contemporary AI development reveals that data quality, rather than model design alone, often determines performance boundaries. This recognition has elevated data benchmarking to a critical field that ensures AI models learn from datasets that are high-quality, diverse, and free from bias.\n\nThis evolution represents a fundamental shift from model-centric to data-centric AI approaches, as illustrated in [Figure 12.11](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-model-vs-data). The traditional model-centric paradigm focuses on enhancing model architectures, refining algorithms, and improving computational efficiency while treating datasets as fixed components. In contrast, the emerging data-centric approach systematically improves dataset quality through better annotations, increased diversity, and bias reduction, while maintaining consistent model architectures and system configurations. Research increasingly demonstrates that methodical dataset enhancement can yield superior performance gains compared to model refinements alone, challenging the conventional emphasis on architectural innovation.\n\n[![Image 12](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking_files/mediabag/e66c88ffc172d27f92b99b5454d93e446fa99392.svg)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/e66c88ffc172d27f92b99b5454d93e446fa99392.svg "Figure\xa012.11: Comparison of model-centric and data-centric AI approaches. Model-centric AI focuses on improving architectures, while data-centric AI emphasizes enhancing dataset quality. Both approaches are complementary in optimizing AI performance.")\n\n Figure 12.11: Comparison of model-centric and data-centric AI approaches. Model-centric AI focuses on improving architectures, while data-centric AI emphasizes enhancing dataset quality. Both approaches are complementary in optimizing AI performance. \n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-model-vs-data)\n\nData quality’s primacy in AI development reflects a fundamental shift in understanding: superior datasets, not just sophisticated models, produce more reliable and robust AI systems. Initiatives like DataPerf and DataComp have emerged to systematically evaluate how dataset improvements affect model performance. For instance, DataComp ([Nishigaki 2024](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-gadre2024datacomp)) demonstrated that models trained on a carefully curated 30% subset of data achieved better results than those trained on the complete dataset, challenging the assumption that more data automatically leads to better performance ([Northcutt, Athalye, and Mueller 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-northcutt2021pervasive)).\n\n Nishigaki, Shinsuke. 2024. “Eigenphase Distributions of Unimodular Circular Ensembles.”_arXiv Preprint arXiv:2401.09045_ 36 (January).

[https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2103.14749](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2103.14749). \n\nA significant challenge in data benchmarking emerges from dataset saturation. When models achieve near-perfect accuracy on benchmarks like ImageNet, it becomes crucial to distinguish whether performance gains represent genuine advances in AI capability or merely optimization to existing test sets. [Figure 12.12](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-dataset-saturation) illustrates this trend, showing AI systems surpassing human performance across various applications over the past decade.\n\n[![Image 13](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/dynabench.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/dynabench.png "Figure\xa012.12: AI vs human performance.

([2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-kiela2021dynabench))\n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-dataset-saturation)\n\nThis saturation phenomenon raises fundamental methodological questions ([Kiela et al. 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-kiela2021dynabench)). The MNIST dataset provides an illustrative example: certain test images, though nearly illegible to humans, were assigned specific labels during the dataset’s creation in 1994. When models correctly predict these labels, their apparent superhuman performance may actually reflect memorization of dataset artifacts rather than true digit recognition capabilities.\n\n Kiela, Douwe, Max Bartolo, Yixin Nie, Divyansh Kaushik, Atticus Geiger, Zhengxuan Wu, Bertie Vidgen, et al. 2021. “Dynabench: Rethinking Benchmarking in NLP.” In _Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies_, 9:418–34. Online: Association for Computational Linguistics. [https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2021.naacl-main.324](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2021.naacl-main.324). \n\n Beyer, Lucas, Olivier J.

[http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07159v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07159v1). \n\nThese challenges extend beyond individual domains. The provocative question “Are we done with ImageNet?” ([Beyer et al. 2020](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-beyer2020we)) highlights broader concerns about the limitations of static benchmarks. Models optimized for fixed datasets often struggle with distribution shifts—real-world changes that occur after training data collection. This limitation has driven the development of dynamic benchmarking approaches, such as Dynabench ([Kiela et al. 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-kiela2021dynabench)), which continuously evolves test data based on model performance to maintain benchmark relevance.\n\nCurrent data benchmarking efforts encompass several critical dimensions. Label quality assessment remains a central focus, as explored in DataPerf’s debugging challenge. Initiatives like MSWC ([Mazumder et al. 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-mazumder2021multilingual)) for speech recognition address bias and representation in datasets. Out-of-distribution generalization receives particular attention through benchmarks like RxRx and WILDS ([Koh et al. 2021](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/references.html#ref-koh2021wilds)). These diverse efforts reflect a growing recognition that advancing AI capabilities requires not just better models and systems, but fundamentally better approaches to data quality assessment and benchmark design.\n\n Mazumder, Mark, Sharad Chitlangia, Colby Banbury, Yiping Kang, Juan Manuel Ciro, Keith Achorn, Daniel Galvez, et al. 2021. “Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus.” In _Thirty-Fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 2)_. \n\n Koh, Pang Wei, Shiori Sagawa, Henrik Marklund, Sang Michael Xie, Marvin Zhang, Akshay Balsubramani, Weihua Hu, et al. 2021. “WILDS: A Benchmark of in-the-Wild Distribution Shifts.” In _Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2021, 18-24 July 2021, Virtual Event_, edited by Marina Meila and Tong Zhang, 139:5637–64.

However, real-world AI performance emerges from the interplay between these three components. A fast system cannot compensate for a poorly trained model, and even the most powerful model is constrained by the quality of the data it learns from. This interdependence necessitates a holistic benchmarking approach that considers all three dimensions together.\n\nAs illustrated in [Figure 12.13](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmarking-trifecta), the future of benchmarking lies in an integrated framework that jointly evaluates system efficiency, model performance, and data quality. This approach enables researchers to identify optimization opportunities that remain invisible when these components are analyzed in isolation. For example, co-designing efficient AI models with hardware-aware optimizations and carefully curated datasets can lead to superior performance while reducing computational costs.\n\n[![Image 14](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/benchmarking_trifecta.png)](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/images/png/benchmarking_trifecta.png "Figure\xa012.13: Benchmarking trifecta.")\n\n Figure 12.13: Benchmarking trifecta. \n\n[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#fig-benchmarking-trifecta)\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, benchmarking methodologies must advance in tandem. Evaluating AI performance through the lens of systems, models, and data ensures that benchmarks drive improvements not just in accuracy, but also in efficiency, fairness, and robustness. This holistic perspective will be critical for developing AI that is not only powerful but also practical, scalable, and ethical.\n\n12.11 Conclusion[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#conclusion)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_“What gets measured gets improved.”_ Benchmarking plays a foundational role in the advancement of AI, providing the essential measurements needed to track progress, identify limitations, and drive innovation. This chapter has explored the multifaceted nature of benchmarking, spanning systems, models, and data, and has highlighted its critical role in optimizing AI performance across different dimensions.\n\nML system benchmarks enable optimizations in speed, efficiency, and scalability, ensuring that hardware and infrastructure can support increasingly complex AI workloads. Model benchmarks provide standardized tasks and evaluation metrics beyond accuracy, driving progress in algorithmic innovation. Data benchmarks, meanwhile, reveal key issues related to data quality, bias, and representation, ensuring that AI models are built on fair and diverse datasets.\n\nWhile these components, systems, models, and data, are often evaluated in isolation, future benchmarking efforts will likely adopt a more integrated approach. By measuring the interplay between system, model, and data benchmarks, AI researchers and engineers can uncover new insights into the co-design of data, algorithms, and infrastructure. This holistic perspective will be essential as AI applications grow more sophisticated and are deployed across increasingly diverse environments.\n\nBenchmarking is not static—it must continuously evolve to capture new AI capabilities, address emerging challenges, and refine evaluation methodologies. As AI systems become more complex and influential, the need for rigorous, transparent, and socially beneficial benchmarking standards becomes even more pressing. Achieving this requires close collaboration between industry, academia, and standardization bodies to ensure that benchmarks remain relevant, unbiased, and aligned with real-world needs.\n\nUltimately, benchmarking serves as the compass that guides AI progress. By persistently measuring and openly sharing results, we can navigate toward AI systems that are performant, robust, and trustworthy. However, benchmarking must also be aligned with human-centered principles, ensuring that AI serves society in a fair and ethical manner. The future of benchmarking is already expanding into new frontiers, including the evaluation of AI safety, fairness, and generative AI models, which will shape the next generation of AI benchmarks. These topics, while beyond the scope of this chapter, will be explored further in the discussion on Generative AI.\n\nFor those interested in emerging trends in AI benchmarking, the article _[The Olympics of AI: Benchmarking Machine Learning Systems](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-olympics-of-ai-benchmarking-machine-learning-systems-c4b2051fbd2b)_ provides a broader look at benchmarking efforts in robotics, extended reality, and neuromorphic computing. As benchmarking continues to evolve, it remains an essential tool for understanding, improving, and shaping the future of AI.\n\n12.12 Resources[](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.html#resources)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Slides \n\n*   [Why is benchmarking important?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17udz3gxeYF3r3X1r4ePwu1I9H8ljb53W3ktFSmuDlGs/edit?usp=drive_link&resourcekey=0-Espn0a0x81kl2txL_jIWjw)\n\n*   [Embedded inference benchmarking.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18PI_0xmcW1xwwfcjmj25PikqBM_92vQfOXFV4hah-6I/edit?resourcekey=0-KO3HQcDAsR--jgbKd5cp4w#slide=id.g94db9f9f78_0_2)\n\n Videos \n\n*   _Coming soon._\n\n Exercises \n\n*   _Coming soon._\n\n[11 AI Acceleration](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/hw_acceleration/hw_acceleration.html)\n\n[13 ML Operations](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/core/ops/ops.html)\n\nWritten, edited and curated by Prof.Vijay Janapa Reddi (Harvard University)\n\n*   [Edit this page](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/edit/widget_quiz/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.qmd)\n*   [Report an issue](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/issues/new)\n*   [View source](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/blob/widget_quiz/contents/core/benchmarking/benchmarking.qmd)\n\nThis book was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).\n'), SearchResult(url='https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/chapters/chapter3/evaluation_and_benchmarking.html', title='3 Evaluation and Benchmarking – Applied Machine Learning ...', raw_content='## Table of contents\n\n# 3\xa0 Evaluation and Benchmarking\n\n**Giuseppe Casalicchio**   \n*Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, and Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML), and Essential Data Science Training GmbH*\n\n**Lukas Burk**   \n*Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, and Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, and Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)*\n\nA supervised machine learning model can only be deployed in practice if it has a good generalization performance, which means it generalizes well to new, unseen data. Accurate estimation of the generalization performance is crucial for many aspects of machine learning application and research – whether we want to fairly compare a novel algorithm with established ones or to find the best algorithm for a particular task. The concept of performance estimation provides information on how well a model will generalize to new data and plays an important role in the context of model comparison ([Section 3.3](#sec-benchmarking)), model selection, and hyperparameter tuning ([Chapter 4](../chapter4/hyperparameter_optimization.html)).\n\nAssessing the generalization performance of a model begins with selecting a performance measure that is appropriate for our given task and evaluation goal. As we have seen in [Section 2.3](../chapter2/data_and_basic_modeling.html#sec-eval), performance measures typically compute a numeric score indicating how well the model predictions match the ground truth (though some technical measures were seen in [Section 2.3.3](../chapter2/data_and_basic_modeling.html#sec-basics-measures-tech)). Once we have decided on a performance measure, the next step is to adopt a strategy that defines how to use the available data to estimate the generalization performance. Using the same data to train and test a model is a bad strategy as it would lead to an overly optimistic performance estimate. For example, a model that is overfitted (fit too closely to the data) could make perfect predictions on training data simply by memorizing it and then only make random guesses for new data. In [Section 2.2.1.1](../chapter2/data_and_basic_modeling.html#sec-basics-partition) we introduced [`partition()`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/partition.html), which splits a dataset into training data – data for training the model – and test data – data for testing the model and estimating the generalization performance, this is known as the holdout strategy ([Section 3.1](#sec-holdout-scoring)) and is where we will begin this chapter. We will then consider more advanced strategies for assessing the generalization performance ([Section 3.2](#sec-resampling)), look at robust methods for comparing models ([Section 3.3](#sec-benchmarking)), and finally will discuss specialized performance measures for binary classification ([Section 3.4](#sec-roc)). For an in-depth overview of measures and performance estimation, we recommend Japkowicz and Shah ([2011](../references.html#ref-japkowicz2011evaluating)).\n\n`partition()`\n\nA common **misunderstanding** is that holdout and other more advanced resampling strategies can prevent model overfitting. In fact, these methods just make overfitting visible as we can separately evaluate train/test performance. Resampling strategies also allow us to make (nearly) unbiased estimations of the generalization error.\n\n## 3.1 Holdout and Scoring\n\nAn important goal of ML is to learn a model that can then be used to make predictions about new data. For this model to be as accurate as possible, we would ideally train it on as much data as is available. However, data is limited and as we have discussed we cannot train and test a model on the same data. In practice, one would usually create an intermediate model, which is trained on a subset of the available data and then tested on the remainder of the data. The performance of this intermediate model, obtained by comparing the model predictions to the ground truth, is an estimate of the generalization performance of the final model, which is the model fitted on all data.\n\nThe holdout strategy is a simple method to create this split between training and testing datasets, whereby the original data is split into two datasets using a defined ratio. Ideally, the training dataset should be as large as possible so the intermediate model represents the final model as well possible. If the training data is too small, the intermediate model is unlikely to perform as well as the final model, resulting in a pessimistically biased performance estimate. On the other hand, if the training data is too large, then we will not have a reliable estimate of the generalization performance due to high variance resulting from small test data. As a rule of thumb, it is common to use 2/3 of the data for training and 1/3 for testing as this provides a reasonable trade-off between bias and variance of the generalization performance estimate ([Kohavi 1995](../references.html#ref-kohavi1995); [Dobbin and Simon 2011](../references.html#ref-dobbin2011)).\n\nIn [Chapter 2](../chapter2/data_and_basic_modeling.html), we used [`partition()`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/partition.html) to apply the holdout method to a [`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) object. To recap, let us split `tsk("penguins")` with a 2/3 holdout (default split):\n\n`partition()`\n`Task`\n`tsk("penguins")`\n`tsk_penguins = tsk("penguins")\nsplits = partition(tsk_penguins)\nlrn_rpart = lrn("classif.rpart")\nlrn_rpart$train(tsk_penguins, splits$train)\nprediction = lrn_rpart$predict(tsk_penguins, splits$test)`\n\nWe can now estimate the generalization performance of a final model by evaluating the quality of the predictions from our intermediate model. As we have seen in [Section 2.3](../chapter2/data_and_basic_modeling.html#sec-eval), this is simply a case of choosing one or more measures and passing them to the `$score()` function. So to estimate the accuracy of our final model we would pass the accuracy measure to our intermediate model:\n\n`$score()`\n`prediction$score(msr("classif.acc"))`\n`classif.acc\n0.9386` \n\nWhen splitting data it is essential to permute observations before, to remove any information that is encoded in data ordering. The order of data is often informative in real-world datasets, for example hospital data will likely be ordered by time of patient admission. In `tsk("penguins")`, the data is ordered such that the first 152 rows all have the label ‘Adelie’, the next 68 have the label ‘Chinstrap’, and the final 124 have the label ‘Gentoo’; so if we did not permute the data we could end up with a model that is only trained on one or two species.\n\n`tsk("penguins")`\n\n`partition()` and all resampling strategies discussed below automatically randomly split the data to prevent any biases (so do not forget to set a seed for reproducibility). Data *within* each set may still be ordered because of implementation details, but this is not a problem as long as the data is shuffled between sets.\n\n`partition()`\n\nMany performance measures are based on ‘decomposable’ losses, which means they compute the differences between the predicted values and ground truth values first on an observation level and then aggregate the individual loss values over the test set into a single numeric score. For example, the classification accuracy compares whether the predicted values from the `response` column have the same value as the ground truth values from the `truth` column of the [`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html) object. Hence, for each observation, the decomposable loss takes either value `1` (if `response` and `truth` have the same value) or `0` otherwise. The `$score()` method summarizes these individual loss values into a an average value – the percentage where our prediction was correct. Other performance measures that are not decomposable instead act on a set of observations, we will return to this in detail when we look at the AUC measure in [Section 3.4](#sec-roc). [Figure\xa03.1](#fig-score) illustrates the input-output behavior of the `$score()` method, we will return to this when we turn to more complex evaluation strategies.\n\n`response`\n`truth`\n`Prediction`\n`1`\n`response`\n`truth`\n`0`\n`$score()`\n`$score()`\n![A funnel-shaped diagram where the far left box shows the output from a classification prediction object with row_ids, truth, and response columns.

An intermediate model is then trained on each training set and the test set is used to measure the performance in each resampling iteration. The generalization performance is finally estimated by aggregating the performance scores over multiple resampling iterations ([Figure\xa03.2](#fig-ml-abstraction)). By repeating the data splitting process, data points are repeatedly used for both training and testing, allowing more efficient use of all available data for performance estimation. Furthermore, a high number of resampling iterations can reduce the variance in our scores and thus result in a more reliable performance estimate. This means that the performance estimate is less likely to be affected by an ‘unlucky’ split (e.g., a split that does not reflect the original data distribution).\n\n`mlr3`\n![A flowchart-like diagram with 3 overlapping boxes. Left box has the caption \'Data splitting / resampling process\', upper right box has caption \'Learning process\', and lower right box has caption \'Evaluation process\'. The process starts in the left box with \'Data\' and an arrow to \'Resampling Strategy\', which separates into two elements stacked vertically: \'Train Set(s)\' above and \'Test Set(s)\' below. The \'Train set(s)\' element leads to a \'Learner\' box, which is inside the larger \'Learning Process\' box. A box that says \'Hyperparameters\' also sits within the \'Learning Process\' and is connected with an arrow also pointing to \'Learner\'.

The \\(k\\) models are always trained on \\(k-1\\) of the folds, with the remaining fold being used as test data; this process is repeated until each fold has acted exactly once as test set. Finally, the \\(k\\) performance estimates from each fold are aggregated, usually by averaging. CV guarantees that each observation will be used exactly once in a test set, making efficient use of the available data for performance estimation. Common values for \\(k\\) are 5 and 10, meaning each training set will consist of 4/5 or 9/10 of the original data, respectively. Several variations of CV exist, including repeated k-fold cross-validation where the k-fold process is repeated multiple times, and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) where the number of folds is equal to the number of observations, leading to the test set in each fold consisting of only one observation.\n\nSubsampling and bootstrapping are two related resampling strategies. Subsampling randomly selects a given ratio (4/5 and 9/10 are common) of the data for the training dataset where each observation in the dataset is drawn *without replacement* from the original dataset. The model is trained on this data and then tested on the remaining data, and this process is repeated \\(k\\) times. This differs from k-fold CV as the subsets of test data may be overlapping. Bootstrapping follows the same process as subsampling but data is drawn *with replacement* from the original dataset. Usually the number of bootstrap samples equals the size of the original dataset. This means an observation could be selected multiple times (and thus duplicated) in the training data (but never more than once per test dataset). On average, \\(1 - e^{-1} \\approx 63.2\\%\\) of the data points will be contained in the training set during bootstrapping, referred to as “in-bag” samples (the other 36.8% are known as “out-of-bag” samples).\n\nNote that terminology regarding resampling strategies is not consistent across the literature, for example, subsampling is sometimes referred to as “repeated holdout” or “Monte Carlo cross-validation”.\n\nThe choice of the resampling strategy usually depends on the specific task at hand and the goals of the performance assessment, but some rules of thumb are available. If the available data is fairly small (\\(N \\leq 500\\)), repeated cross-validation with a large number of repetitions can be used to keep the variance of the performance estimates low (10 folds and 10 repetitions is a good place to start). Traditionally, LOO-CV has also been recommended for these small sample size regimes, but this estimation scheme is quite expensive (except in special cases where computational shortcuts exist) and (counterintuitively) suffers from quite high variance. Furthermore, LOO-CV is also problematic in imbalanced binary classification tasks as concepts such as stratification ([Section 3.2.5](#sec-strat-group)) cannot be applied. For the \\(500 \\leq N \\leq 50000\\) range, 5- to 10-fold CV is generally recommended. In general, the larger the dataset, the fewer splits are required, yet sample-size issues can still occur, e.g., due to imbalanced data. For settings where one is more interested in proper inference (such as through statistical performance tests or confidence intervals) than bare point estimators of performance, bootstrapping and subsampling are often considered, usually with a higher number of iterations. Bootstrapping has become less common, as having repeated observations in training data can lead to problems in some machine learning setups, especially when combined with model selection methods and nested resampling (as duplicated observations can then end up simultaneously in training and test sets in nested schemes). Also note that in all of these common and simple schemes, resampling performance estimates are not independent, as models are fitted on overlapping training data, making proper inference less than trivial, but a proper treatment of these issues is out of scope for us here. For further details and critical discussion we refer to the literature, e.g., Molinaro, Simon, and Pfeiffer ([2005](../references.html#ref-molinaro2005prediction)), Kim ([2009](../references.html#ref-kim2009estimating)), and Bischl et al. ([2012](../references.html#ref-bischl2012resampling)).\n\n![Complex flow chart in roughly three rows.

For example, to construct the holdout strategy with a 4/5 split (2/3 by default):\n\n`Resampling`\n`rsmp()`\n`Resampling`\n`rsmp()`\n`rsmp("holdout", ratio = 0.8)`\n`── <ResamplingHoldout> : Holdout ────────────────────────────────────────\n• Iterations: 1\n• Instantiated: FALSE\n• Parameters: ratio=0.8`\n\nParameters for objects inheriting from `Resampling` work in the same way as measures and learners and can be set, retrieved, and updated accordingly:\n\n`Resampling`\n`# three-fold CV\ncv3 = rsmp("cv", folds = 3)\n# Subsampling with 3 repeats and 9/10 ratio\nss390 = rsmp("subsampling", repeats = 3, ratio = 0.9)\n# 2-repeats 5-fold CV\nrcv25 = rsmp("repeated_cv", repeats = 2, folds = 5)`\n\nWhen a `"Resampling"` object is constructed, it is simply a definition for how the data splitting process will be performed on the task when running the resampling strategy. However, it is possible to manually instantiate a resampling strategy, i.e., generate all train-test splits, by calling the `$instantiate()` method on a given task. So carrying on our `tsk("penguins")` example we can instantiate the three-fold CV object and then view the row indices of the data selected for training and testing each fold using `$train_set()` and `$test_set()` respectively:\n\n`"Resampling"`\n`$instantiate()`\n`tsk("penguins")`\n`$train_set()`\n`$test_set()`\n`$instantiate()`\n`cv3$instantiate(tsk_penguins)\n# first 5 observations in first training set\ncv3$train_set(1)[1:5]`\n`[1] 1 4 5 8 16`\n`# first 5 observations in third test set\ncv3$test_set(3)[1:5]`\n`[1] 2 6 10 13 19`\n\nWhen the aim is to fairly compare multiple learners, best practice dictates that all learners being compared use the same training data to build a model and that they use the same test data to evaluate the model performance. Resampling strategies are instantiated automatically for you when using the `resample()` method, which we will discuss next. Therefore, manually instantiating resampling strategies is rarely required but might be useful for debugging or digging deeper into a model’s performance.\n\n`resample()`\n\n### 3.2.2 Resampling Experiments\n\nThe [`resample()`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/resample.html) function takes a given `Task`, `Learner`, and [`Resampling`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Resampling.html) object to run the given resampling strategy. `resample()` repeatedly fits a model on training sets, makes predictions on the corresponding test sets and stores them in a [`ResampleResult`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/ResampleResult.html) object, which contains all the information needed to estimate the generalization performance.\n\n`resample()`\n`Task`\n`Learner`\n`Resampling`\n`resample()`\n`ResampleResult`\n`resample()`\n`ResampleResult`\n`rr = resample(tsk_penguins, lrn_rpart, cv3)\nrr`\n`── <ResampleResult> with 3 resampling iterations ────────────────────────\ntask_id learner_id resampling_id iteration prediction_test\npenguins classif.rpart cv 1 <PredictionClassif>\npenguins classif.rpart cv 2 <PredictionClassif>\npenguins classif.rpart cv 3 <PredictionClassif>\n2 variables not shown: [warnings, errors]`\n\nEach row of the output corresponds to one of the three iterations/folds. As with `Prediction` objects, we can calculate the score *for each iteration* with `$score()`:\n\n`Prediction`\n`$score()`\n`acc = rr$score(msr("classif.ce"))\nacc[, .(iteration, classif.ce)]`\n `iteration classif.ce\n1: 1 0.06087\n2: 2 0.05217\n3: 3 0.07018`\n\nBy default, `$score()` evaluates the performance in the *test* sets in each iteration, however, you could evaluate the *train* set performance, see ?sec-valid-tuning.\n\n`$score()`\n\nWhile `$score()` returns the performance in each evaluation, `$aggregate()`, returns the aggregated score across all resampling iterations.\n\n`$score()`\n`$aggregate()`\n`rr$aggregate(msr("classif.ce"))`\n`classif.ce\n0.06107` \n\nBy default, the majority of measures will aggregate scores using a macro average, which first calculates the measure in each resampling iteration separately, and then averages these scores across all iterations. However, it is also possible to aggregate scores using a micro average, which pools predictions across resampling iterations into one [`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html) object and then computes the measure on this directly:\n\n`Prediction`\n`rr$aggregate(msr("classif.ce", average = "micro"))`\n`classif.ce\n0.06105` \n\nWe can see a *small* difference between the two methods. Classification error is a decomposable loss ([Section 3.1](#sec-holdout-scoring)), in fact, if the test sets all had the same size then the micro and macro methods would be identical (see box below). For errors like AUC, which are defined across the set of observations, the difference between micro- and macro-averaging will be larger. The default type of aggregation method can be found by querying the `$average` field of a [`Measure`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Measure.html) object.\n\n`$average`\n`Measure`\n\nAs a simple example to explain macro- and micro-averaging, consider the difference between taking the mean of a vector (micro) compared to the mean of two group-wise means (macro):\n\n`# macro\nmean(mean(c(3, 5, 9)), mean(c(1, 5)))`\n`[1] 5.667`\n`# micro\nmean(c(3, 5, 9, 1, 5))`\n`[1] 4.6`\n\nIn the example shown in the main text where we used `tsk("penguins")`, there is a difference in the classification error between micro and macro methods because the dataset has 344 rows, which is not divisible by three (the number of folds), hence the test sets are not of an equal size.\n\n`tsk("penguins")`\n\nNote that the terms “macro-averaging” and “micro-averaging” are not used consistently in the literature, and sometimes refer to different concepts, e.g., the way in which the performance is aggregated across classes in a multi-class classification task.\n\nThe aggregated score returned by `$aggregate()` estimates the generalization performance of our selected learner on the given task using the resampling strategy defined in the `Resampling` object. While we are usually interested in this aggregated score, it can be useful to look at the individual performance values of each resampling iteration (as returned by the `$score()` method) as well, e.g., to see if any of the iterations lead to very different performance results. [Figure\xa03.4](#fig-score-aggregate-resampling) visualizes the relationship between `$score()` and `$aggregate()` for a small example based on the `"penguins"` task.\n\n`$aggregate()`\n`Resampling`\n`$score()`\n`$score()`\n`$aggregate()`\n`"penguins"`\n![A funnel-shaped diagram.

Right: $aggregate() reduces predictions across all resampling iterations to a single performance score.](Figures/mlr3book_figures-5.svg)\n`$score()`\n`$aggregate()`\n\nTo visualize the resampling results, you can use the [`autoplot.ResampleResult()`](https://mlr3viz.mlr-org.com/reference/autoplot.ResampleResult.html) function to plot scores across folds as boxplots or histograms ([Figure\xa03.5](#fig-resamp-viz)). Histograms can be useful to visually gauge the variance of the performance results across resampling iterations, whereas boxplots are often used when multiple learners are compared side-by-side (see [Section 3.3](#sec-benchmarking)).\n\n`autoplot.ResampleResult()`\n`rr = resample(tsk_penguins, lrn_rpart, rsmp("cv", folds = 10))\nautoplot(rr, measure = msr("classif.acc"), type = "boxplot")\nautoplot(rr, measure = msr("classif.acc"), type = "histogram")`\n![Left: a boxplot ranging from 0.875 to 1.0 and the interquartile range between 0.925 and 0.7.

We can use the `$predictions()` method to obtain a list of [`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html) objects corresponding to the predictions from each resampling iteration. This can be used to analyze the predictions of individual intermediate models from each resampling iteration. To understand the class better, we use it here to manually compute a macro averaged performance estimate.\n\n`ResampleResult`\n`$predictions()`\n`Prediction`\n`# list of prediction objects\nrrp = rr$predictions()\n# print first two\nrrp[1:2]`\n`[[1]]\n── <PredictionClassif> for 35 observations: ─────────────────────────────\nrow_ids truth response\n20 Adelie Chinstrap\n21 Adelie Adelie\n33 Adelie Adelie\n--- --- ---\n307 Chinstrap Adelie\n322 Chinstrap Chinstrap\n333 Chinstrap Chinstrap\n[[2]]\n── <PredictionClassif> for 35 observations: ─────────────────────────────\nrow_ids truth response\n8 Adelie Adelie\n41 Adelie Adelie\n44 Adelie Chinstrap\n--- --- ---\n309 Chinstrap Adelie\n312 Chinstrap Chinstrap\n331 Chinstrap Adelie`\n`# macro averaged performance\nmean(sapply(rrp, function(.x) .x$score()))`\n`[1] 0.05529`\n\nThe `$prediction()` method can be used to extract a single `Prediction` object that combines the predictions of each intermediate model across all resampling iterations. The combined prediction object can, for example, be used to manually compute a micro-averaged performance estimate (see [Section 3.2.2](#sec-resampling-exec) for how to you can micro-average more conveniently).\n\n`$prediction()`\n`Prediction`\n`prediction = rr$prediction()\nprediction`\n`── <PredictionClassif> for 344 observations: ────────────────────────────\nrow_ids truth response\n20 Adelie Chinstrap\n21 Adelie Adelie\n33 Adelie Adelie\n--- --- ---\n330 Chinstrap Chinstrap\n337 Chinstrap Gentoo\n340 Chinstrap Gentoo`\n`prediction$score()`\n`classif.ce\n0.05523` \n\nBy default, the intermediate models produced at each resampling iteration are discarded after the prediction step to reduce memory consumption of the `ResampleResult` object (only the predictions are required to calculate most performance measures). However, it can sometimes be useful to inspect, compare, or extract information from these intermediate models. We can configure the [`resample()`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/resample.html) function to keep the fitted intermediate models by setting `store_models = TRUE`. Each model trained in a specific resampling iteration can then be accessed via `$learners[[i]]$model`, where `i` refers to the `i`-th resampling iteration:\n\n`ResampleResult`\n`resample()`\n`store_models = TRUE`\n`$learners[[i]]$model`\n`i`\n`i`\n`rr = resample(tsk_penguins, lrn_rpart, cv3, store_models = TRUE)\n# get the model from the first iteration\nrr$learners[[1]]$model`\n`n= 229\nnode), split, n, loss, yval, (yprob)\n* denotes terminal node\n1) root 229 122 Adelie (0.46725 0.18777 0.34498)\n2) bill_length< 42.35 98 0 Adelie (1.00000 0.00000 0.00000) *\n3) bill_length>=42.35 131 52 Gentoo (0.06870 0.32824 0.60305)\n6) island=Dream,Torgersen 50 7 Chinstrap (0.14000 0.86000 0.00000)\n12) island=Torgersen 7 0 Adelie (1.00000 0.00000 0.00000) *\n13) island=Dream 43 0 Chinstrap (0.00000 1.00000 0.00000) *\n7) island=Biscoe 81 2 Gentoo (0.02469 0.00000 0.97531) *`\n\nIn this example, we could then inspect the most important variables in each iteration to help us learn more about the respective fitted models:\n\n`# print 2nd and 3rd iteration\nlapply(rr$learners[2:3], function(x) x$model$variable.importance)`\n`[[1]]\nbill_length flipper_length bill_depth body_mass\n84.81 80.59 67.52 57.39\nisland\n49.11\n[[2]]\nflipper_length bill_length bill_depth island\n88.62 82.10 66.59 61.50\nbody_mass\n60.37` \n\n### 3.2.4 Custom Resampling\n\nSometimes it is necessary to perform resampling with custom splits, e.g., to reproduce results reported in a study with pre-defined folds.\n\nA custom holdout resampling strategy can be constructed using `rsmp("custom")`, where the row IDs of the observations used for training and testing must be defined manually when instantiated with a task. In the example below, we first construct a custom holdout resampling strategy by manually assigning row IDs to the `$train` and `$test` fields, then construct a resampling strategy with two iterations by passing row IDs as list elements:\n\n`rsmp("custom")`\n`$train`\n`$test`\n`rsmp_custom = rsmp("custom")\n\n# resampling strategy with two iterations\ntrain_sets = c(1:5, 153:158, 277:280)\nrsmp_custom$instantiate(tsk_penguins,\n train = list(train_sets, train_sets + 5),\n test = list(train_sets + 15, train_sets + 25)\n)\nresample(tsk_penguins, lrn_rpart, rsmp_custom)$prediction()`\n`── <PredictionClassif> for 30 observations: ─────────────────────────────\nrow_ids truth response\n16 Adelie Gentoo\n17 Adelie Gentoo\n18 Adelie Gentoo\n--- --- ---\n303 Chinstrap Gentoo\n304 Chinstrap Gentoo\n305 Chinstrap Gentoo`\n\nA custom cross-validation strategy can be more efficiently constructed with `rsmp("custom_cv")`. In this case, we now have to specify either a custom `factor` variable or a `factor` column from the data to determine the folds. In the example below, we use a smaller version of `tsk("penguins")` and instantiate a custom two-fold CV strategy using a `factor` variable called `folds` where the first and third rows are used as the test set in Fold 1, and the second and fourth rows are used as the test set in Fold 2:\n\n`rsmp("custom_cv")`\n`factor`\n`factor`\n`tsk("penguins")`\n`factor`\n`folds`\n`tsk_small = tsk("penguins")$filter(c(1, 100, 200, 300))\nrsmp_customcv = rsmp("custom_cv")\nfolds = as.factor(c(1, 2, 1, 2))\nrsmp_customcv$instantiate(tsk_small, f = folds)\nresample(tsk_small, lrn_rpart, rsmp_customcv)$predictions()`\n`[[1]]\n── <PredictionClassif> for 2 observations: ──────────────────────────────\nrow_ids truth response\n1 Adelie Adelie\n200 Gentoo Adelie\n[[2]]\n── <PredictionClassif> for 2 observations: ──────────────────────────────\nrow_ids truth response\n100 Adelie Adelie\n300 Chinstrap Adelie`\n\n### 3.2.5 Stratification and Grouping\n\nUsing column roles ([Section 2.6](../chapter2/data_and_basic_modeling.html#sec-row-col-roles)), it is possible to group or stratify observations according to a particular column in the data. We will look at each of these in turn.\n\n#### Grouped Resampling\n\nKeeping observations together when the data is split can be useful, and sometimes essential, during resampling – spatial analysis ([Section 13.5](../chapter13/beyond_regression_and_classification.html#sec-spatiotemporal)) is a prominent example, as observations belong to natural groups (e.g., countries). When observations belong to groups, we need to ensure all observations of the same group belong to *either* the training set *or* the test set to prevent potential leakage of information between training and testing. For example, in a longitudinal study, measurements are taken from the same individual at multiple time points. If we do not group these, we might overestimate the model’s generalization capability to unseen individuals, because observations of the same individuals might simultaneously be in the train and test set. In this context, the leave-one-out cross-validation strategy can be coarsened to the “leave-one-object-out” cross-validation strategy, where all observations associated with a certain group are left out ([Figure\xa03.6](#fig-group)).\n\n![Three images, each shows a green box with text \'Train\' and white space around it with text \'Test\'. Left (Iteration 1): green box with blue and red dots inside it and yellow dots outside it. Middle (Iteration 2): green box with blue and yellow dots inside it and red dots outside it. Right (Iteration 3): green box with yellow and red dots inside it and blue dots outside it.](Figures/mlr3book_figures-7.svg)\n\nThe `"group"` column role allows us to specify the column in the data that defines the group structure of the observations. In the following code, we construct a leave-one-out resampling strategy, assign the `"group"` role to the ‘year’ column of `tsk("penguins")`, instantiate the resampling strategy, and finally show how the years are nicely separated in the first fold.\n\n`"group"`\n`"group"`\n`tsk("penguins")`\n`rsmp_loo = rsmp("loo")\ntsk_grp = tsk("penguins")\ntsk_grp$set_col_roles("year", "group")\nrsmp_loo$instantiate(tsk_grp)\ntable(tsk_grp$data(rows = rsmp_loo$train_set(1), cols = "year"))`\n`year\n2007 2008\n110 114` \n`table(tsk_grp$data(rows = rsmp_loo$test_set(1), cols = "year"))`\n`year\n2009\n120` \n\nOther cross-validation techniques work in a similar way, where folds are determined at a group level (as opposed to an observation level).\n\n#### Stratified Sampling\n\nStratified sampling ensures that one or more discrete features within the training and test sets will have a similar distribution as in the original task containing all observations. This is especially useful when a discrete feature is highly imbalanced and we want to make sure that the distribution of that feature is similar in each resampling iteration ([Figure\xa03.7](#fig-stratification)). We can also stratify on the target feature to ensure that each intermediate model is fit on training data where the class distribution of the target is representative of the actual task, this is useful to ensure target classes are not strongly under-represented by random chance in individual resampling iterations, which would lead to degenerate estimations of the generalization performance.\n\n![The figure shows rectangles in yellow and green to represent the majority and minority class respectively. On the left side are rectangles corresponding to the task before it is split; the majority class (yellow) on the left is clearly larger than the minority class (green) on the right. This is labeled \'Imabalanced Class Distribution\'. In the next three boxes, labeled \'Iteration 1-3\' respectively, the size difference between the majority and minority classes is preserved, i.e., the difference in size between majority and minority classes are equal.](Figures/mlr3book_figures-8.svg)\n\nUnlike grouping, it is possible to stratify by multiple discrete features using the `"stratum"` column role ([Section 2.6](../chapter2/data_and_basic_modeling.html#sec-row-col-roles)). In this case, strata would be formed out of each combination of the stratified features, e.g., for two stratified features A and B with levels Aa, Ab; Ba, Bb respectively then the created stratum would have the levels AaBa, AaBb, AbBa, AbBb.\n\n`"stratum"`\n\n`tsk("penguins")` displays imbalance in the `species` column, as can be seen in the output below:\n\n`tsk("penguins")`\n`species`\n`prop.table(table(tsk_penguins$data(cols = "species")))`\n`species\nAdelie Chinstrap Gentoo\n0.4419 0.1977 0.3605` \n\nWithout specifying a `"stratum"` column role, the `species` column may have quite different class distributions across the CV folds, as can be seen in the example below.\n\n`"stratum"`\n`species`\n`rsmp_cv10 = rsmp("cv", folds = 10)\nrsmp_cv10$instantiate(tsk_penguins)\n\nfold1 = prop.table(table(tsk_penguins$data(rows = rsmp_cv10$test_set(1),\n cols = "species")))\nfold2 = prop.table(table(tsk_penguins$data(rows = rsmp_cv10$test_set(2),\n cols = "species")))\n\nrbind("Fold 1" = fold1, "Fold 2" = fold2)`\n `Adelie Chinstrap Gentoo\nFold 1 0.6286 0.1143 0.2571\nFold 2 0.5143 0.1714 0.3143`\n\nWe can see across folds how Chinstrap is represented quite differently (0.11 vs.\xa00.17)\n\nWhen imbalance is severe, minority classes might not occur in the training sets entirely. Consequently, the intermediate models within these resampling iterations will never predict the missing class, resulting in a misleading performance estimate for any resampling strategy without stratification. The code below uses `species` as `"stratum"` column role to illustrate that the distribution of `species` in each test set will closely match the original distribution:\n\n`species`\n`"stratum"`\n`species`\n`tsk_str = tsk("penguins")\n# set species to have both the \'target\' and \'stratum\' column role\ntsk_str$set_col_roles("species", c("target", "stratum"))\nrsmp_cv10$instantiate(tsk_str)\n\nfold1 = prop.table(table(tsk_str$data(rows = rsmp_cv10$test_set(1),\n cols = "species")))\nfold2 = prop.table(table(tsk_str$data(rows = rsmp_cv10$test_set(2),\n cols = "species")))\n\nrbind("Fold 1" = fold1, "Fold 2" = fold2)`\n `Adelie Chinstrap Gentoo\nFold 1 0.4444 0.1944 0.3611\nFold 2 0.4444 0.1944 0.3611`\n\nYou can view the observations that fall into each stratum using the `$strata` field of a `Task` object, this can be particularly useful when we are interested in multiple strata:\n\n`$strata`\n`Task`\n`tsk_str$set_col_roles("year", "stratum")\ntsk_str$strata`\n `N row_id\n1: 50 1,2,3,4,5,6,...\n2: 50 51,52,53,54,55,56,...\n3: 52 101,102,103,104,105,106,...\n4: 34 153,154,155,156,157,158,...\n5: 46 187,188,189,190,191,192,...\n6: 44 233,234,235,236,237,238,...\n7: 26 277,278,279,280,281,282,...\n8: 18 303,304,305,306,307,308,...\n9: 24 321,322,323,324,325,326,...`\n`# N above matches with numbers in table below\ntable(tsk_penguins$data(cols = c("species", "year")))`\n `year\nspecies 2007 2008 2009\nAdelie 50 50 52\nChinstrap 26 18 24\nGentoo 34 46 44`\n\n## 3.3 Benchmarking\n\nBenchmarking in supervised machine learning refers to the comparison of different learners on one or more tasks. When comparing *multiple learners on a single task* or on a domain consisting of multiple similar tasks, the main aim is often to rank the learners according to a pre-defined performance measure and to identify the best-performing learner for the considered task or domain. When comparing *multiple learners on multiple tasks*, the main aim is often more of a scientific nature, e.g., to gain insights into how different learners perform in different data situations or whether there are certain data properties that heavily affect the performance of certain learners (or certain hyperparameters of learners). It is common (and good) practice for algorithm designers to analyze the generalization performance or runtime of a newly proposed learning algorithm in comparison to existing learners in a benchmark experiment. Since benchmarks usually consist of many evaluations that can be run independently of each other, `mlr3` offers the possibility of parallelizing them automatically, which we demonstrate in [Section 10.1.2](../chapter10/advanced_technical_aspects_of_mlr3.html#sec-parallel-resample). In this section, we will focus on the basic setup of benchmark experiments that will be applicable in the majority of use cases, in [Chapter 11](../chapter11/large-scale_benchmarking.html) we will look at more complex, large-scale, benchmark experiments.\n\n`mlr3`\n\n### 3.3.1 benchmark()\n\nBenchmark experiments in `mlr3` are conducted with [`benchmark()`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/benchmark.html), which simply runs [`resample()`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/resample.html) on each task and learner separately, then collects the results. The provided resampling strategy is automatically instantiated on each task to ensure that all learners are compared against the same training and test data.\n\n`mlr3`\n`benchmark()`\n`resample()`\n\nTo use the `benchmark()` function we first call [`benchmark_grid()`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/benchmark_grid.html), which constructs an exhaustive *design* to describe all combinations of the learners, tasks and resamplings to be used in a benchmark experiment, and instantiates the resampling strategies. By example, below we set up a design to see if a random forest, decision tree, or featureless baseline ([Section 2.2.4](../chapter2/data_and_basic_modeling.html#sec-basics-featureless)), performs best across two classification tasks.\n\n`benchmark()`\n`benchmark_grid()`\n`tasks = tsks(c("german_credit", "sonar"))\nlearners = lrns(c("classif.rpart", "classif.ranger",\n "classif.featureless"), predict_type = "prob")\nrsmp_cv5 = rsmp("cv", folds = 5)\n\ndesign = benchmark_grid(tasks, learners, rsmp_cv5)\nhead(design)`\n `task learner resampling\n1: german_credit classif.rpart cv\n2: german_credit classif.ranger cv\n3: german_credit classif.featureless cv\n4: sonar classif.rpart cv\n5: sonar classif.ranger cv\n6: sonar classif.featureless cv`\n\nThe resulting design is essentially just a `data.table`, which can be modified if you want to remove particular combinations or could even be created from scratch without the `benchmark_grid()` function. Note that this `data.table` has list columns that contain R6 objects of tasks, learners, and resampling instances.\n\n`data.table`\n`benchmark_grid()`\n`data.table`\n`benchmark_grid()`\n\nBy default, [`benchmark_grid()`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/benchmark_grid.html) instantiates the resamplings on the tasks, which means that concrete train-test splits are generated. Since this process is stochastic, it is necessary to set a seed **before** calling `benchmark_grid()` to ensure reproducibility of the data splits.\n\n`benchmark_grid()`\n`benchmark_grid()`\n\nThe constructed benchmark design can then be passed to `benchmark()` to run the experiment and the result is a [`BenchmarkResult`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/BenchmarkResult.html) object:\n\n`benchmark()`\n`BenchmarkResult`\n`bmr = benchmark(design)\nbmr`\n`── <BenchmarkResult> of 30 rows with 6 resampling run ───────────────────\nnr task_id learner_id resampling_id iters warnings\n1 german_credit classif.rpart cv 5 0\n2 german_credit classif.ranger cv 5 0\n3 german_credit classif.featureless cv 5 0\n4 sonar classif.rpart cv 5 0\n5 sonar classif.ranger cv 5 0\n6 sonar classif.featureless cv 5 0\n1 variable not shown: [errors]`\n\nAs `benchmark()` is just an extension of `resample()`, we can once again use `$score()`, or `$aggregate()` depending on your use-case, though note that in this case `$score()` will return results over each fold of each learner/task/resampling combination.\n\n`benchmark()`\n`resample()`\n`$score()`\n`$aggregate()`\n`$score()`\n`bmr$score()[c(1, 7, 13), .(iteration, task_id, learner_id, classif.ce)]`\n `iteration task_id learner_id classif.ce\n1: 1 german_credit classif.rpart 0.245\n2: 2 german_credit classif.ranger 0.170\n3: 3 german_credit classif.featureless 0.315`\n`bmr$aggregate()[, .(task_id, learner_id, classif.ce)]`\n `task_id learner_id classif.ce\n1: german_credit classif.rpart 0.2620\n2: german_credit classif.ranger 0.2220\n3: german_credit classif.featureless 0.3000\n4: sonar classif.rpart 0.3365\n5: sonar classif.ranger 0.1871\n6: sonar classif.featureless 0.5388`\n\nThis would conclude a basic benchmark experiment where you can draw tentative conclusions about model performance, in this case we would possibly conclude that the random forest is the best of all three models on each task. We draw conclusions cautiously here as we have not run any statistical tests or included standard errors of measures, so we cannot definitively say if one model outperforms the other.\n\nAs the results of `$score()` and `$aggregate()` are returned in a `data.table`, you can post-process and analyze the results in any way you want. A common *mistake* is to average the learner performance across all tasks when the tasks vary significantly. This is a mistake as averaging the performance will miss out important insights into how learners compare on ‘easier’ or more ‘difficult’ predictive problems. A more robust alternative to compare the overall algorithm performance across multiple tasks is to compute the ranks of each learner on each task separately and then calculate the average ranks. This can provide a better comparison as task-specific ‘quirks’ are taken into account by comparing learners within tasks before comparing them across tasks. However, using ranks will lose information about the numerical differences between the calculated performance scores. Analysis of benchmark experiments, including statistical tests, is covered in more detail in [Section 11.3](../chapter11/large-scale_benchmarking.html#sec-benchmark-analysis).\n\n`$score()`\n`$aggregate()`\n`data.table`\n\n### 3.3.2 BenchmarkResult Objects\n\nA [`BenchmarkResult`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/BenchmarkResult.html) object is a collection of multiple [`ResampleResult`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/ResampleResult.html) objects.\n\n`BenchmarkResult`\n`ResampleResult`\n`bmrdt = as.data.table(bmr)\nbmrdt[1:2, .(task, learner, resampling, iteration)]`\n `task learner\n1: <TaskClassif:german_credit> <LearnerClassifRpart:classif.rpart>\n2: <TaskClassif:german_credit> <LearnerClassifRpart:classif.rpart>\n2 variables not shown: [resampling, iteration]`\n\nThe contents of a `BenchmarkResult` and `ResampleResult` ([Section 3.2.3](#sec-resampling-inspect)) are almost identical and the stored `ResampleResult`s can be extracted via the `$resample_result(i)` method, where `i` is the index of the performed resample experiment. This allows us to investigate the extracted `ResampleResult` and individual resampling iterations as shown in [Section 3.2](#sec-resampling), as well as the predictions from each fold with `$resample_result(i)$predictions()`.\n\n`BenchmarkResult`\n`ResampleResult`\n`ResampleResult`\n`$resample_result(i)`\n`i`\n`ResampleResult`\n`$resample_result(i)$predictions()`\n`rr1 = bmr$resample_result(1)\nrr1`\n`── <ResampleResult> with 5 resampling iterations ────────────────────────\ntask_id learner_id resampling_id iteration prediction_test\ngerman_credit classif.rpart cv 1 <PredictionClassif>\ngerman_credit classif.rpart cv 2 <PredictionClassif>\ngerman_credit classif.rpart cv 3 <PredictionClassif>\ngerman_credit classif.rpart cv 4 <PredictionClassif>\ngerman_credit classif.rpart cv 5 <PredictionClassif>\n2 variables not shown: [warnings, errors]`\n`rr2 = bmr$resample_result(2)`\n\nIn addition, [`as_benchmark_result()`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/as_benchmark_result.html) can be used to convert objects from `ResampleResult` to `BenchmarkResult`. The `c()`-method can be used to combine multiple `BenchmarkResult` objects, which can be useful when conducting experiments across multiple machines:\n\n`as_benchmark_result()`\n`ResampleResult`\n`BenchmarkResult`\n`c()`\n`BenchmarkResult`\n`bmr1 = as_benchmark_result(rr1)\nbmr2 = as_benchmark_result(rr2)\n\nc(bmr1, bmr2)`\n`── <BenchmarkResult> of 10 rows with 2 resampling run ───────────────────\nnr task_id learner_id resampling_id iters warnings errors\n1 german_credit classif.rpart cv 5 0 0\n2 german_credit classif.ranger cv 5 0 0`\n\nBoxplots are most commonly used to visualize benchmark experiments as they can intuitively summarize results across tasks and learners simultaneously.\n\n`autoplot(bmr, measure = msr("classif.acc"))`\n![Nine boxplots, one corresponding to each task/learner combination. In all cases the random forest performs best and the featureless baseline the worst.](evaluation_and_benchmarking_files/figure-html/fig-benchmark-box-1.png)\n`lrn("classif.ranger")`\n\n## 3.4 Evaluation of Binary Classifiers\n\nIn [Section 2.5.3](../chapter2/data_and_basic_modeling.html#sec-basics-classif-learner) we touched on the concept of a confusion matrix and how it can be used to break down classification errors in more detail. In this section, we will look at specialized performance measures for binary classification in more detail. We will first return to the confusion matrix and discuss measures that can be derived from it and then will look at ROC analysis which builds on these measures. See Chapters 7 and 8 of Provost and Fawcett ([2013](../references.html#ref-provost2013)) for a more detailed introduction to ROC measures.\n\n### 3.4.1 Confusion Matrix\n\nTo recap, a confusion matrix summarizes the following quantities in a two-dimensional contingency table (see also [Figure\xa03.9](#fig-confusion)):\n\nDifferent applications may have a particular interest in one (or multiple) of the aforementioned quantities. For example, the `tsk("spam")` classification task is concerned with classifying if mail is spam (positive class) or not (negative class). In this case, we are likely to accept FNs (some spam classified as genuine mail) as long as we have a low number of FPs (genuine and possibly important mail classified as spam). In another example, say we are predicting if a travel bag contains a weapon (positive class) or not (negative class) at an airport. This classifier must have a very high number of TPs (as FNs are not acceptable at all), even if this comes at the expense of more FPs (false alarms).\n\n`tsk("spam")`\n\nAs we saw in [Section 2.5.3](../chapter2/data_and_basic_modeling.html#sec-basics-classif-learner), it is possible for a classifier to have a good classification accuracy but to overlook the nuances provided by a full confusion matrix, as in the following `tsk("german_credit")` example:\n\n`tsk("german_credit")`\n`tsk_german = tsk("german_credit")\nlrn_ranger = lrn("classif.ranger", predict_type = "prob")\nsplits = partition(tsk_german, ratio = 0.8)\n\nlrn_ranger$train(tsk_german, splits$train)\nprediction = lrn_ranger$predict(tsk_german, splits$test)\nprediction$score(msr("classif.acc"))`\n`classif.acc\n0.795` \n`prediction$confusion`\n `truth\nresponse good bad\ngood 131 34\nbad 7 28`\n\nThe classification accuracy only takes into account the TPs and TNs, whereas the confusion matrix provides a more holistic picture of the classifier’s performance.\n\nOn their own, the absolute numbers in a confusion matrix can be less useful when there is class imbalance. Instead, several normalized measures can be derived ([Figure\xa03.9](#fig-confusion)):\n\n![Representation of a confusion matrix with entries \'TP\' when both \'True class y\' is \'+\'\' and \'Predicted Class yhat\' is \'+\', \'TN\' when both are \'-\', \'FP\' when True is \'-\' and Predicted is \'+\' and finally \'FN\' when True is \'+\' but Predicted is \'-\'. In the margins is \'PPV = TP/(TP+FP)\', \'NPV = TN/(FN+TN)\', \'ACC=(TP+TN)/(TP+FP+FN+TN)\', \'TNR=TN/(FP+TN)\', \'TPR=TP/(TP+FN)\'.](Figures/confusion_matrix.svg)\n\nThe [`mlr3measures`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mlr3measures) package allows you to compute several common confusion matrix-based measures using the [`confusion_matrix()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mlr3measures/topics/confusion_matrix) function:\n\n`mlr3measures`\n`confusion_matrix()`\n`mlr3measures::confusion_matrix(truth = prediction$truth,\n response = prediction$response, positive = tsk_german$positive)`\n `truth\nresponse good bad\ngood 131 34\nbad 7 28\nacc : 0.7950; ce : 0.2050; dor : 15.4118; f1 : 0.8647\nfdr : 0.2061; fnr : 0.0507; fomr: 0.2000; fpr : 0.5484\nmcc : 0.4880; npv : 0.8000; ppv : 0.7939; tnr : 0.4516\ntpr : 0.9493` \n\nWe now have a better idea of the random forest predictions on `tsk("german_credit")`, in particular, the false positive rate is quite high. It is generally difficult to achieve a high TPR and low FPR simultaneously because there is often a trade-off between the two rates. When a binary classifier predicts probabilities instead of discrete classes (`predict_type = "prob"`), we could set a threshold to cut off the probabilities to change how we assign observations to the positive/negative class (see [Section 2.5.4](../chapter2/data_and_basic_modeling.html#sec-classif-prediction)). Increasing the threshold for identifying the positive cases, leads to a higher number of negative predictions, fewer positive predictions, and therefore a lower (and better) FPR but a lower (and worse) TPR – the reverse holds if we lower the threshold. Instead of arbitrarily changing a threshold to ‘game’ these two numbers, a more robust way to tradeoff between TPR and FPR is to use ROC analysis, discussed next.\n\n`tsk("german_credit")`\n`predict_type = "prob"`\n\n### 3.4.2 ROC Analysis\n\nROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis is widely used to evaluate binary classifiers by visualizing the trade-off between the TPR and the FPR.\n\nThe ROC curve is a line graph with TPR on the y-axis and the FPR on the x-axis. To understand the usefulness of this curve, first consider the simple case of a hard labeling classifier (`predict_type = "response"`) that classifies observations as either positive or negative. This classifier would be represented as a single point in the ROC space (see [Figure\xa03.10](#fig-roc), panel (a)). The best classifier would lie on the top-left corner where the TPR is \\(1\\) and the FPR is \\(0\\). Classifiers on the diagonal predict class labels randomly (with different class proportions). For example, if each positive instance will be randomly classified (ignoring features) with 25% as the positive class, we would obtain a TPR of 0.25. If we assign each negative instance randomly to the positive class, we would have an FPR of 0.25. In practice, we should never obtain a classifier below the diagonal and a point in the ROC space below the diagonal might indicate that the positive and negative class labels have been switched by the classifier.\n\n`predict_type = "response"`\n`Warning in geom_text(aes(x = 0.5, y = 0.5, hjust = 0.5, vjust = -0.5, label = "random classifiers"), : All aesthetics have length 1, but the data has 2 rows.\nℹ Please consider using `annotate()` or provide this layer with data\ncontaining a single row.`\n`Warning in geom_text(aes(x = 0.5, y = 0.5, hjust = 0.5, vjust = -0.5, label = "baseline"), : All aesthetics have length 1, but the data has 2 rows.\nℹ Please consider using `annotate()` or provide this layer with data\ncontaining a single row.`\n![Two plots labeled (a) and (b). Both have \'FPR\' between 0-1 on x-axis and \'TPR\' between 0-1 on y-axis, both also have a diagonal line y=x with text \'baseline (random classifiers)\'. (a): There is a green dot in upper left corner at (0,1). There is a triangle labeled C1 at around (0.1,0.75), a square labeled C2 at around (0.24, 0.75), and a plus labeled C3 at around (0.25, 0.8). (b) is same as (a) except now there are three dashed lines such that each of the points from (a) lies on one of these lines. The lines roughly curve from (0,0) towards (0,1) and then to (1,1)](evaluation_and_benchmarking_files/figure-html/fig-roc-1.png)\n\nNow consider classifiers that predict probabilities instead of discrete classes. Using different thresholds to cut off predicted probabilities and assign them to the positive and negative class will lead to different TPRs and FPRs and by plotting these values across different thresholds we can characterize the behavior of a binary classifier – this is the ROC curve. For example, we can use the previous [`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html) object to compute all possible TPR and FPR combinations by thresholding the predicted probabilities across all possible thresholds, which is exactly what `mlr3viz::autoplot.PredictionClassif` will do when `type = "roc"` is selected:\n\n`Prediction`\n`mlr3viz::autoplot.PredictionClassif`\n`type = "roc"`\n`autoplot(prediction, type = "roc")`\n![ROC curve with "1 - Specificity" on x-axis (between 0-1) and "Sensitivity" on y-axis (between 0-1). There is a line from around (0,0) to (0.3,0.75) to (1, 1).](evaluation_and_benchmarking_files/figure-html/fig-basics-roc-ranger-1.png)\n`german_credit`\n`classif.ranger`\n\nA natural performance measure that can be derived from the ROC curve is the area under the curve (AUC), implemented in `msr("classif.auc")`. The AUC can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen positive instance has a higher predicted probability of belonging to the positive class than a randomly chosen negative instance. Therefore, higher values (closer to \\(1\\)) indicate better performance. Random classifiers (such as the featureless baseline) will always have an AUC of (approximately, when evaluated empirically) 0.5 (see [Figure\xa03.10](#fig-roc), panel (b)).\n\n`msr("classif.auc")`\n`prediction$score(msr("classif.auc"))`\n`classif.auc\n0.8319` \n\nEvaluating our random forest on `tsk("german_credit")` results in an AUC of around 0.83, which is acceptable but could be better.\n\n`tsk("german_credit")`\n\nExtensions of ROC analysis for multiclass classifiers exist (see e.g., [Hand and Till 2001](../references.html#ref-hand2001simple)) but we only cover the more common binary classification case in this book. Generalizations of the AUC measure to multiclass classification are implemented in `mlr3`, see `msr("classif.mauc_au1p")`.\n\n`mlr3`\n`msr("classif.mauc_au1p")`\n\nWe can also plot the precision-recall curve (PRC) which visualizes the PPV/precision vs.\xa0TPR/recall. The main difference between ROC curves and PR curves is that the number of true-negatives are ignored in the latter. This can be useful in imbalanced populations where the positive class is rare, and where a classifier with high TPR may still not be very informative and have low PPV. See Davis and Goadrich ([2006](../references.html#ref-davis2006relationship)) for a detailed discussion about the relationship between the PRC and ROC curves.\n\n`autoplot(prediction, type = "prc")`\n![Line curve with "Recall" on x-axis (between 0-1) and "Precision" on y-axis (between 0-1).

We also covered the basics of performance measures for binary classification, including the confusion matrix, ROC analysis, and precision-recall curves. These topics are fundamental in supervised learning and will continue to be built upon throughout this book.

practice if it has a good `r index("generalization performance", aside = TRUE)`, which means it generalizes well to new, unseen data.\nAccurate estimation of the generalization performance is crucial for many aspects of machine learning application and research -- whether we want to fairly compare a novel algorithm with established ones or to find the best algorithm for a particular task.\nThe concept of `r index("performance estimation")` provides information on how well a model will generalize to new data and plays an important role in the context of model comparison (@sec-benchmarking), model selection, and hyperparameter tuning (@sec-optimization).\n\nAssessing the generalization performance of a model begins with selecting a `r index("performance measure")` that is appropriate for our given task and evaluation goal.\nAs we have seen in @sec-eval, performance measures typically compute a numeric score indicating how well the model predictions match the ground truth (though some technical measures were seen in @sec-basics-measures-tech).\nOnce we have decided on a performance measure, the next step is to adopt a strategy that defines how to use the available data to estimate the generalization performance.\nUsing the same data to train and test a model is a bad strategy as it would lead to an overly optimistic performance estimate.\nFor example, a model that is overfitted (fit too closely to the data) could make perfect predictions on training data simply by memorizing it and then only make random guesses for new data.\nIn @sec-basics-partition we introduced `r ref("partition()")`, which splits a dataset into `r index(\'training data\')` -- data for training the model -- and `r index(\'test data\')` -- data for testing the model and estimating the generalization performance, this is known as the holdout strategy (@sec-holdout-scoring) and is where we will begin this chapter.\nWe will then consider more advanced strategies for assessing the generalization performance (@sec-resampling), look at robust methods for comparing models (@sec-benchmarking), and finally will discuss specialized performance measures for binary classification (@sec-roc).\nFor an in-depth overview of measures and performance estimation, we recommend @japkowicz2011evaluating.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Resampling Does Not Avoid Model Overfitting\nA common **misunderstanding** is that holdout and other more advanced resampling strategies can prevent model overfitting.\nIn fact, these methods just make overfitting visible as we can separately evaluate train/test performance.\nResampling strategies also allow us to make (nearly) unbiased estimations of the generalization error.\n:::\n\n## Holdout and Scoring {#sec-holdout-scoring}\n\nAn important goal of ML is to learn a model that can then be used to make predictions about new data.\nFor this model to be as accurate as possible, we would ideally train it on as much data as is available.\nHowever, data is limited and as we have discussed we cannot train and test a model on the same data.\nIn practice, one would usually create an `r index(\'intermediate model\', aside = TRUE)`, which is trained on a subset of the available data and then tested on the remainder of the data.\nThe performance of this intermediate model, obtained by comparing the model predictions to the ground truth, is an estimate of the generalization performance of the final model, which is the model fitted on all data.\n\nThe `r index(\'holdout\', aside = TRUE)` strategy is a simple method to create this split between training and testing datasets, whereby the original data is split into two datasets using a defined ratio.\nIdeally, the training dataset should be as large as possible so the intermediate model represents the final model as well possible.\nIf the training data is too small, the intermediate model is unlikely to perform as well as the final model, resulting in a pessimistically biased performance estimate.\nOn the other hand, if the training data is too large, then we will not have a reliable estimate of the generalization performance due to high variance resulting from small test data.\nAs a rule of thumb, it is common to use 2/3 of the data for training and 1/3 for testing as this provides a reasonable trade-off between bias and variance of the generalization performance estimate [@kohavi1995;@dobbin2011].\n\nIn @sec-basics, we used `r ref("partition()")` to apply the holdout method to a `r ref("Task")` object.\nTo recap, let us split `tsk("penguins")` with a 2/3 holdout (default split):\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-001}\ntsk_penguins = tsk("penguins")\nsplits = partition(tsk_penguins)\nlrn_rpart = lrn("classif.rpart")\nlrn_rpart$train(tsk_penguins, splits$train)\nprediction = lrn_rpart$predict(tsk_penguins, splits$test)\n```\n\nWe can now estimate the generalization performance of a final model by evaluating the quality of the predictions from our intermediate model.\nAs we have seen in @sec-eval, this is simply a case of choosing one or more measures and passing them to the `$score()` function.\nSo to estimate the accuracy of our final model we would pass the accuracy measure to our intermediate model:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-002}\nprediction$score(msr("classif.acc"))\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Permuting Observations for Performance Estimation\nWhen splitting data it is essential to permute observations before, to remove any information that is encoded in data ordering.\nThe order of data is often informative in real-world datasets, for example hospital data will likely be ordered by time of patient admission.\nIn `tsk("penguins")`, the data is ordered such that the first 152 rows all have the label \'Adelie\', the next 68 have the label \'Chinstrap\', and the final 124 have the label \'Gentoo\'; so if we did not permute the data we could end up with a model that is only trained on one or two species.\n\n`partition()` and all resampling strategies discussed below automatically randomly split the data to prevent any biases (so do not forget to set a seed for reproducibility).\nData *within* each set may still be ordered because of implementation details, but this is not a problem as long as the data is shuffled between sets.\n:::\n\nMany performance measures are based on \'decomposable\' losses, which means they compute the differences between the predicted values and ground truth values first on an observation level and then aggregate the individual loss values over the test set into a single numeric score.\nFor example, the classification accuracy compares whether the predicted values from the `response` column have the same value as the ground truth values from the `truth` column of the `r ref("Prediction")` object.\nHence, for each observation, the decomposable loss takes either value `1` (if `response` and `truth` have the same value) or `0` otherwise.\nThe `$score()` method summarizes these individual loss values into a an average value -- the percentage where our prediction was correct.\nOther performance measures that are not decomposable instead act on a set of observations, we will return to this in detail when we look at the AUC measure in @sec-roc.\n@fig-score illustrates the input-output behavior of the `$score()` method, we will return to this when we turn to more complex evaluation strategies.\n\n```{r

Usually the number of bootstrap samples equals the size of the original dataset.\nThis means an observation could be selected multiple times (and thus duplicated) in the training data (but never more than once per test dataset).\nOn average, $1 - e^{-1} \\approx 63.2\\%$ of the data points will be contained in the training set during bootstrapping, referred to as "in-bag" samples (the other 36.8% are known as "out-of-bag" samples).\n\nNote that terminology regarding resampling strategies is not consistent across the literature, for example, subsampling is sometimes referred to as "repeated holdout" \\index{repeated holdout|see{subsampling}} or "Monte Carlo cross-validation"\\index{Monte Carlo cross-validation|see{subsampling}}.\n\nThe choice of the resampling strategy usually depends on the specific task at hand and the goals of the performance assessment, but some rules of thumb are available.\nIf the available data is fairly small ($N \\leq 500$), repeated cross-validation with a large number of repetitions can be used to keep the variance of the performance estimates low (10 folds and 10 repetitions is a good place to start).\nTraditionally, LOO-CV has also been recommended for these small sample size regimes, but this estimation scheme is quite expensive (except in special cases where computational shortcuts exist) and (counterintuitively) suffers from quite high variance. Furthermore, LOO-CV is also problematic in imbalanced binary classification tasks as concepts such as stratification (@sec-strat-group) cannot be applied.\nFor the $500 \\leq N \\leq 50000$ range, 5- to 10-fold CV is generally recommended.\nIn general, the larger the dataset, the fewer splits are required, yet sample-size issues can still occur, e.g., due to imbalanced data.\nFor settings where one is more interested in proper inference (such as through statistical performance tests or confidence intervals) than bare point estimators of performance, bootstrapping and subsampling are often considered, usually with a higher number of iterations. Bootstrapping has become less common, as having repeated observations in training data can lead to problems in some machine learning setups, especially when combined with model selection methods and nested resampling (as duplicated observations can then end up simultaneously in training and test sets in nested schemes). Also note that in all of these common and simple schemes, resampling performance estimates are not independent, as models are fitted on overlapping training data, making proper inference less than trivial, but a proper treatment of these issues is out of scope for us here. For further details and critical discussion we refer to the literature, e.g., @molinaro2005prediction, @kim2009estimating, and @bischl2012resampling.\n\n<!-- Source: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BJXJ365C9TWelojV93IeQJAtEiD3uZMFSfkhzgYH-n8/edit?usp=sharing -->\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-005, echo=FALSE}\n#| label: fig-cv-illustration\n#| fig-cap: "Illustration of a three-fold cross-validation."\n#| fig-alt: "Complex flow chart in roughly three rows.

splits, and then performing resampling on learners.\n\n### Constructing a Resampling Strategy {#sec-resampling-construct}\n\nAll implemented resampling strategies are stored in the `r ref("mlr_resamplings")` dictionary.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-006}\nas.data.table(mlr_resamplings)\n```\n\nThe `params` column shows the parameters of each resampling strategy (e.g., the train-test splitting `ratio` or the number of `repeats`) and `iters` displays the number of performed resampling iterations by default.\n\n`r ref("Resampling", aside = TRUE)` objects can be constructed by passing the strategy \'key\' to the sugar function `r ref("rsmp()", aside = TRUE)`.\nFor example, to construct the holdout strategy with a 4/5 split (2/3 by default):\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-007}\nrsmp("holdout", ratio = 0.8)\n```\n\nParameters for objects inheriting from `Resampling` work in the same way as measures and learners and can be set, retrieved, and updated accordingly:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-008}\n# three-fold CV\ncv3 = rsmp("cv", folds = 3)\n# Subsampling with 3 repeats and 9/10 ratio\nss390 = rsmp("subsampling", repeats = 3, ratio = 0.9)\n# 2-repeats 5-fold CV\nrcv25 = rsmp("repeated_cv", repeats = 2, folds = 5)\n```\n\nWhen a `"Resampling"` object is constructed, it is simply a definition for how the data splitting process will be performed on the task when running the resampling strategy.\nHowever, it is possible to manually instantiate a resampling strategy, i.e., generate all train-test splits, by calling the `$instantiate()`\\index{\\texttt{Resampling}!\\texttt{\\$instantiate()}}[`$instantiate()`]{.aside} method on a given task.\nSo carrying on our `tsk("penguins")` example we can instantiate the three-fold CV object and then view the row indices of the data selected for training and testing each fold using `$train_set()` and `$test_set()` respectively:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-009}\ncv3$instantiate(tsk_penguins)\n# first 5 observations in first training set\ncv3$train_set(1)[1:5]\n# first 5 observations in third test set\ncv3$test_set(3)[1:5]\n```\n\nWhen the aim is to fairly compare multiple learners, best practice dictates that all learners being compared use the same training data to build a model and that they use the same test data to evaluate the model performance.\nResampling strategies are instantiated automatically for you when using the `resample()` method, which we will discuss next.\nTherefore, manually instantiating resampling strategies is rarely required but might be useful for debugging or digging deeper into a model\'s performance.\n\n### Resampling Experiments {#sec-resampling-exec}\n\nThe `r ref("resample()", aside = TRUE)` function takes a given `Task`, `Learner`, and `r ref("Resampling")` object to run the given resampling strategy.\n`resample()` repeatedly fits a model on training sets, makes predictions on the corresponding test sets and stores them in a `r ref("ResampleResult", aside = TRUE)` object, which contains all the information needed to estimate the generalization performance.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-010}\nrr = resample(tsk_penguins, lrn_rpart, cv3)\nrr\n```\n\nEach row of the output corresponds to one of the three iterations/folds.\nAs with `Prediction` objects, we can calculate the score *for each iteration* with `$score()`:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-011}\nacc = rr$score(msr("classif.ce"))\nacc[, .(iteration, classif.ce)]\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Evaluating Train Sets\nBy default, `$score()` evaluates the performance in the *test* sets in each iteration, however, you could evaluate the *train* set performance, see @sec-valid-tuning.\n:::\n\nWhile `$score()` returns the performance in each evaluation, `r index(\'$aggregate()\', parent = "Learner", aside = TRUE, code = TRUE)`, returns the aggregated score across all resampling iterations.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-012}\nrr$aggregate(msr("classif.ce"))\n```\n\nBy default, the majority of measures will aggregate scores using a `r index("macro average")`, which first calculates the measure in each resampling iteration separately, and then averages these scores across all iterations.\nHowever, it is also possible to aggregate scores using a `r index("micro average")`, which pools predictions across resampling iterations into one `r ref("Prediction")` object and then computes the measure on this directly:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-013}\nrr$aggregate(msr("classif.ce", average = "micro"))\n```\n\nWe can see a *small* difference between the two methods.\nClassification error is a decomposable loss (@sec-holdout-scoring), in fact, if the test sets all had the same size then the micro and macro methods would be identical (see box below).\nFor errors like AUC, which are defined across the set of observations, the difference between micro- and macro-averaging will be larger.\nThe default type of aggregation method can be found by querying the `$average` field of a `r ref("Measure")` object.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Macro- and Micro-Averaging\nAs a simple example to explain macro- and micro-averaging, consider the difference between taking the mean of a vector (micro) compared to the mean of two group-wise means (macro):\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-014}\n# macro\nmean(mean(c(3, 5, 9)), mean(c(1, 5)))\n# micro\nmean(c(3, 5, 9, 1, 5))\n```\n\nIn the example shown in the main text where we used `tsk("penguins")`, there is a difference in the classification error between micro and macro methods because the dataset has 344 rows, which is not divisible by three (the number of folds), hence the test sets are not of an equal size.\n\nNote that the terms "macro-averaging" and "micro-averaging" are not used consistently in the literature, and sometimes refer to different concepts, e.g., the way in which the performance is aggregated across classes in a multi-class classification task.\n:::\n\nThe aggregated score returned by `$aggregate()` estimates the generalization performance of our selected learner on the given task using the resampling strategy defined in the `Resampling` object.\nWhile we are usually interested in this aggregated score, it can be useful to look at the individual performance values of each resampling iteration (as returned by the `$score()` method) as well, e.g., to see if any of the iterations lead to very different performance results.\n@fig-score-aggregate-resampling visualizes the relationship between `$score()` and `$aggregate()` for a small example based on the `"penguins"` task.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-015}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-score-aggregate-resampling\n#| fig-cap: "An example of the difference between `$score()` and `$aggregate()`: The former aggregates predictions to a single score within each resampling iteration, and the latter aggregates scores across all resampling iterations."\n#| fig-alt: "A funnel-shaped diagram. Left: Each resampling iteration contains multiple rows of predictions, with 3 iterations total. Middle: $score() reduces those to one performance score per resampling iteration, which leaves 3 scores. Right: $aggregate() reduces predictions across all resampling iterations to a single performance score."\ninclude_multi_graphics("mlr3book_figures-5")\n```\n\nTo visualize the resampling results, you can use the `r ref("mlr3viz::autoplot.ResampleResult()")` function to plot scores across folds as boxplots or histograms (@fig-resamp-viz).\nHistograms can be useful to visually gauge the variance of the performance results across resampling iterations, whereas boxplots are often used when multiple learners are compared side-by-side (see @sec-benchmarking).\n\n\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-016}\n#| eval: false\nrr = resample(tsk_penguins, lrn_rpart, rsmp("cv", folds = 10))\nautoplot(rr, measure = msr("classif.acc"), type = "boxplot")\nautoplot(rr, measure = msr("classif.acc"), type = "histogram")\n```\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-017}\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n#| label: fig-resamp-viz\n#| fig-subcap:\n#| - "Boxplot of accuracy scores."\n#| - "Histogram of accuracy scores."\n#| fig-cap: "Boxplot and Histogram of accuracy scores."\n#| message: false\n#| fig-alt: "Left: a boxplot ranging from 0.875 to 1.0 and the interquartile range between 0.925 and 0.7.

"histogram")\nplt2$layers[[1]]$aes_params$fill = "white"\nprint(plt2)\n```\n\n\n### ResampleResult Objects {#sec-resampling-inspect}\n\nAs well as being useful for estimating the generalization performance, the `r ref("ResampleResult")` object can also be used for model inspection.\nWe can use the `$predictions()` method to obtain a list of `r ref("Prediction")` objects corresponding to the predictions from each resampling iteration.\nThis can be used to analyze the predictions of individual intermediate models from each resampling iteration.\nTo understand the class better, we use it here to manually compute a macro averaged performance estimate.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-018}\n# list of prediction objects\nrrp = rr$predictions()\n# print first two\nrrp[1:2]\n\n# macro averaged performance\nmean(sapply(rrp, function(.x) .x$score()))\n```\n\nThe `$prediction()` method can be used to extract a single `Prediction` object that combines the predictions of each intermediate model across all resampling iterations.\nThe combined prediction object can, for example, be used to manually compute a micro-averaged performance estimate (see @sec-resampling-exec for how to you can micro-average more conveniently).\n\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-019}\nprediction = rr$prediction()\nprediction\nprediction$score()\n```\n\nBy default, the intermediate models produced at each resampling iteration are discarded after the prediction step to reduce memory consumption of the `ResampleResult` object (only the predictions are required to calculate most performance measures).\nHowever, it can sometimes be useful to inspect, compare, or extract information from these intermediate models.\nWe can configure the `r ref("resample()")` function to keep the fitted intermediate models by setting `store_models = TRUE`.\nEach model trained in a specific resampling iteration can then be accessed via `$learners[[i]]$model`, where `i` refers to the `i`-th resampling iteration:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-020}\nrr = resample(tsk_penguins, lrn_rpart, cv3, store_models = TRUE)\n# get the model from the first iteration\nrr$learners[[1]]$model\n```\n\nIn this example, we could then inspect the most important variables in each iteration to help us learn more about the respective fitted models:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-021}\n# print 2nd and 3rd iteration\nlapply(rr$learners[2:3], function(x) x$model$variable.importance)\n```\n\n### Custom Resampling {#sec-resamp-custom}\n\n{{< include ../../common/_optional.qmd >}}\n\nSometimes it is necessary to perform resampling with custom splits, e.g., to reproduce results reported in a study with pre-defined folds.\n\nA custom holdout resampling strategy can be constructed using `rsmp("custom")`, where the row IDs of the observations used for training and testing must be defined manually when instantiated with a task.\nIn the example below, we first construct a custom holdout resampling strategy by manually assigning row IDs to the `$train` and `$test` fields, then construct a resampling strategy with two iterations by passing row IDs as list elements:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-022}\nrsmp_custom = rsmp("custom")\n\n# resampling strategy with two iterations\ntrain_sets = c(1:5, 153:158, 277:280)\nrsmp_custom$instantiate(tsk_penguins,\n train = list(train_sets, train_sets + 5),\n test = list(train_sets + 15, train_sets + 25)\n)\nresample(tsk_penguins, lrn_rpart, rsmp_custom)$prediction()\n```\n\nA custom cross-validation strategy can be more efficiently constructed with `rsmp("custom_cv")`.\nIn this case, we now have to specify either a custom `factor` variable or a `factor` column from the data to determine the folds.\nIn the example below, we use a smaller version of `tsk("penguins")` and instantiate a custom two-fold CV strategy using a `factor` variable called `folds` where the first and third rows are used as the test set in Fold 1, and the second and fourth rows are used as the test set in Fold 2:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-023}\ntsk_small = tsk("penguins")$filter(c(1, 100, 200, 300))\nrsmp_customcv = rsmp("custom_cv")\nfolds = as.factor(c(1, 2, 1, 2))\nrsmp_customcv$instantiate(tsk_small, f = folds)\nresample(tsk_small, lrn_rpart, rsmp_customcv)$predictions()\n```\n\n### Stratification and Grouping {#sec-strat-group}\n\n{{< include ../../common/_optional.qmd >}}\n\nUsing column roles (@sec-row-col-roles), it is possible to group or stratify observations according to a particular column in the data.\nWe will look at each of these in turn.\n\n#### `r index(\'Grouped Resampling\')` {.unlisted .unnumbered}\n\nKeeping observations together when the data is split can be useful, and sometimes essential, during resampling -- spatial analysis (@sec-spatiotemporal) is a prominent example, as observations belong to natural groups (e.g., countries).\nWhen observations belong to groups, we need to ensure all observations of the same group belong to *either* the training set *or* the test set to prevent potential leakage of information between training and testing.\nFor example, in a longitudinal study, measurements are taken from the same individual at multiple time points.\nIf we do not group these, we might overestimate the model\'s generalization capability to unseen individuals, because observations of the same individuals might simultaneously be in the train and test set.\nIn this context, the leave-one-out cross-validation strategy can be coarsened to the "leave-one-object-out" cross-validation strategy, where all observations associated with a certain group are left out (@fig-group).\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-024, echo=FALSE}\n#| label: fig-group\n#| fig-cap: "Illustration of the train-test splits of a leave-one-object-out cross-validation with 3 groups of observations (highlighted by different colors)."\n#| fig-alt: "Three images, each shows a green box with text \'Train\' and white space around it with text \'Test\'. Left (Iteration 1): green box with blue and red dots inside it and yellow dots outside it. Middle (Iteration 2): green box with blue and yellow dots inside it and red dots outside it. Right (Iteration 3): green box with yellow and red dots inside it and blue dots outside it."\ninclude_multi_graphics("mlr3book_figures-7")\n```\n\nThe `"group"` column role allows us to specify the column in the data that defines the group structure of the observations.\nIn the following code, we construct a leave-one-out resampling strategy, assign the `"group"` role to the \'year\' column of `tsk("penguins")`, instantiate the resampling strategy, and finally show how the years are nicely separated in the first fold.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-025}\nrsmp_loo = rsmp("loo")\ntsk_grp = tsk("penguins")\ntsk_grp$set_col_roles("year", "group")\nrsmp_loo$instantiate(tsk_grp)\ntable(tsk_grp$data(rows = rsmp_loo$train_set(1), cols = "year"))\ntable(tsk_grp$data(rows = rsmp_loo$test_set(1), cols = "year"))\n```\n\nOther cross-validation techniques work in a similar way, where folds are determined at a group level (as opposed to an observation level).\n\n#### `r index(\'Stratified Sampling\')` {.unlisted .unnumbered}\n\nStratified sampling ensures that one or more discrete features within the training and test sets will have a similar distribution as in the original task containing all observations.\nThis is especially useful when a discrete feature is highly imbalanced and we want to make sure that the distribution of that feature is similar in each resampling iteration (@fig-stratification).\nWe can also stratify on the target feature to ensure that each intermediate model is fit on training data where the class distribution of the target is representative of the actual task, this is useful to ensure target classes are not strongly under-represented by random chance in individual resampling iterations, which would lead to degenerate estimations of the generalization performance.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-026, echo=FALSE}\n#| label: fig-stratification\n#| fig-cap: "Illustration of a three-fold cross-validation with stratification for an imbalanced binary classification task with a majority class that is about twice as large as the minority class. In each resampling iteration, the class distribution from the available data is preserved (which is not necessarily the case for cross-validation without stratification)."\n#| fig-alt: "The figure shows rectangles in yellow and green to represent the majority and minority class respectively. On the left side are rectangles corresponding to the task before it is split; the majority class (yellow) on the left is clearly larger than the minority class (green) on the right. This is labeled \'Imabalanced Class Distribution\'. In the next three boxes, labeled \'Iteration 1-3\' respectively, the size difference between the majority and minority classes is preserved, i.e., the difference in size between majority and minority classes are equal."\ninclude_multi_graphics("mlr3book_figures-8")\n```\n\nUnlike grouping, it is possible to stratify by multiple discrete features using the `"stratum"` column role (@sec-row-col-roles).\nIn this case, strata would be formed out of each combination of the stratified features, e.g., for two stratified features A and B with levels Aa, Ab; Ba, Bb respectively then the created stratum would have the levels AaBa, AaBb, AbBa, AbBb.\n\n`tsk("penguins")` displays imbalance in the `species` column, as can be seen in the output below:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-027}\nprop.table(table(tsk_penguins$data(cols = "species")))\n```\n\nWithout specifying a `"stratum"` column role, the `species` column may have quite different class distributions across the CV folds, as can be seen in the example below.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-028}\nrsmp_cv10 = rsmp("cv", folds = 10)\nrsmp_cv10$instantiate(tsk_penguins)\n\nfold1 = prop.table(table(tsk_penguins$data(rows = rsmp_cv10$test_set(1),\n cols = "species")))\nfold2 = prop.table(table(tsk_penguins$data(rows = rsmp_cv10$test_set(2),\n cols = "species")))\n\nrbind("Fold 1" = fold1, "Fold 2" = fold2)\n```\n\nWe can see across folds how Chinstrap is represented quite differently (`r round(prop.table(table(tsk_penguins$data(rows = rsmp_cv10$test_set(1), cols = "species")))[2],2)` vs. `r round(prop.table(table(tsk_penguins$data(rows = rsmp_cv10$test_set(2), cols = "species")))[2],2)`)\n\nWhen imbalance is severe, minority classes might not occur in the training sets entirely.\nConsequently, the intermediate models within these resampling iterations will never predict the missing class, resulting in a misleading performance estimate for any resampling strategy without stratification.\nThe code below uses `species` as `"stratum"` column role to illustrate that the distribution of `species` in each test set will closely match the original distribution:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-029}\ntsk_str = tsk("penguins")\n# set species to have both the \'target\' and \'stratum\' column role\ntsk_str$set_col_roles("species", c("target", "stratum"))\nrsmp_cv10$instantiate(tsk_str)\n\nfold1 = prop.table(table(tsk_str$data(rows = rsmp_cv10$test_set(1),\n cols = "species")))\nfold2 = prop.table(table(tsk_str$data(rows = rsmp_cv10$test_set(2),\n cols = "species")))\n\nrbind("Fold 1" = fold1, "Fold 2" = fold2)\n```\n\nYou can view the observations that fall into each stratum using the `$strata` field of a `Task` object, this can be particularly useful when we are interested in multiple strata:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-030}\ntsk_str$set_col_roles("year", "stratum")\ntsk_str$strata\n# N above matches with numbers in table below\ntable(tsk_penguins$data(cols = c("species", "year")))\n```\n\n## Benchmarking {#sec-benchmarking}\n\nBenchmarking in supervised machine learning refers to the comparison of different learners on one or more tasks.\nWhen comparing *multiple learners on a single task* or on a domain consisting of multiple similar tasks, the main aim is often to rank the learners according to a pre-defined performance measure and to identify the best-performing learner for the considered task or domain.\nWhen comparing *multiple learners on multiple tasks*, the main aim is often more of a scientific nature, e.g., to gain insights into how different learners perform in different data situations or whether there are certain data properties that heavily affect the performance of certain learners (or certain hyperparameters of learners).\nIt is common (and good) practice for algorithm designers to analyze the generalization performance or runtime of a newly proposed learning algorithm in comparison to existing learners in a `r index("benchmark experiment")`.\nSince benchmarks usually consist of many evaluations that can be run independently of each other, `mlr3` offers the possibility of parallelizing them automatically, which we demonstrate in @sec-parallel-resample.\nIn this section, we will focus on the basic setup of benchmark experiments that will be applicable in the majority of use cases, in @sec-large-benchmarking we will look at more complex, large-scale, benchmark experiments.\n\n### benchmark() {#sec-bm-design}\n\n`r index(\'Benchmark experiments\')` in `mlr3` are conducted with `r ref("benchmark()", index = TRUE)`, which simply runs `r ref("resample()", index = TRUE)` on each task and learner separately, then collects the results.\nThe provided resampling strategy is automatically instantiated on each task to ensure that all learners are compared against the same training and test data.\n\nTo use the `benchmark()` function we first call `r ref("benchmark_grid()")`, which constructs an exhaustive *design* to describe all combinations of the learners, tasks and resamplings to be used in a benchmark experiment, and instantiates the resampling strategies.\nBy example, below we set up a design to see if a random forest, decision tree, or featureless baseline (@sec-basics-featureless), performs best across two classification tasks.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-031}\ntasks = tsks(c("german_credit", "sonar"))\nlearners = lrns(c("classif.rpart", "classif.ranger",\n "classif.featureless"), predict_type = "prob")\nrsmp_cv5 = rsmp("cv", folds = 5)\n\ndesign = benchmark_grid(tasks, learners, rsmp_cv5)\nhead(design)\n```\n\nThe resulting design is essentially just a `data.table`, which can be modified if you want to remove particular combinations or could even be created from scratch without the `benchmark_grid()` function.\nNote that this `data.table` has list columns that contain R6 objects of tasks, learners, and resampling instances.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Reproducibility When Using `benchmark_grid()`\n\nBy default, `r ref("benchmark_grid()")` instantiates the resamplings on the tasks, which means that concrete train-test splits are generated.\nSince this process is stochastic, it is necessary to set a seed **before** calling `benchmark_grid()` to ensure reproducibility of the data splits.\n:::\n\nThe constructed benchmark design can then be passed to `benchmark()` to run the experiment and the result is a `r ref("BenchmarkResult")` object:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-032}\nbmr = benchmark(design)\nbmr\n```\n\nAs `benchmark()` is just an extension of `resample()`, we can once again use `$score()`, or `$aggregate()` depending on your use-case, though note that in this case `$score()` will return results over each fold of each learner/task/resampling combination.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-033}\nbmr$score()[c(1, 7, 13), .(iteration, task_id, learner_id, classif.ce)]\nbmr$aggregate()[, .(task_id, learner_id, classif.ce)]\n```\n\nThis would conclude a basic benchmark experiment where you can draw tentative conclusions about model performance, in this case we would possibly conclude that the random forest is the best of all three models on each task.\nWe draw conclusions cautiously here as we have not run any statistical tests or included standard errors of measures, so we cannot definitively say if one model outperforms the other.\n\nAs the results of `$score()` and `$aggregate()` are returned in a `data.table`, you can post-process and analyze the results in any way you want.\nA common *mistake* is to average the learner performance across all tasks when the tasks vary significantly.\nThis is a mistake as averaging the performance will miss out important insights into how learners compare on \'easier\' or more \'difficult\' predictive problems.\nA more robust alternative to compare the overall algorithm performance across multiple tasks is to compute the ranks of each learner on each task separately and then calculate the average ranks.\nThis can provide a better comparison as task-specific \'quirks\' are taken into account by comparing learners within tasks before comparing them across tasks.\nHowever, using ranks will lose information about the numerical differences between the calculated performance scores.\nAnalysis of benchmark experiments, including statistical tests, is covered in more detail in @sec-benchmark-analysis.\n\n### BenchmarkResult Objects {#sec-bm-resamp}\n\nA `r ref("BenchmarkResult")` object is a collection of multiple `r ref("ResampleResult", index = TRUE)` objects.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-034}\nbmrdt = as.data.table(bmr)\nbmrdt[1:2, .(task, learner, resampling, iteration)]\n```\n\nThe contents of a `BenchmarkResult` and `ResampleResult` (@sec-resampling-inspect) are almost identical and the stored `ResampleResult`s can be extracted via the `$resample_result(i)` method, where `i` is the index of the performed resample experiment.\nThis allows us to investigate the extracted `ResampleResult` and individual resampling iterations as shown in @sec-resampling, as well as the predictions from each fold with `$resample_result(i)$predictions()`.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-035}\nrr1 = bmr$resample_result(1)\nrr1\nrr2 = bmr$resample_result(2)\n```\n\nIn addition, `r ref(\'as_benchmark_result()\')` can be used to convert objects from `ResampleResult` to `BenchmarkResult`.\nThe `c()`-method can be used to combine multiple `BenchmarkResult` objects, which can be useful when conducting experiments across multiple machines:\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-036}\nbmr1 = as_benchmark_result(rr1)\nbmr2 = as_benchmark_result(rr2)\n\nc(bmr1, bmr2)\n```\n\nBoxplots are most commonly used to visualize benchmark experiments as they can intuitively summarize results across tasks and learners simultaneously.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-037}\n#| output: false\n#| cache: false\nautoplot(bmr, measure = msr("classif.acc"))\n```\n\n```{r

It is calculated as $2 \\times \\frac{Precision \\times Recall}{Precision + Recall}$.\n\n```{r evaluation_and_benchmarking-040}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-confusion\n#| fig-cap: "Binary confusion matrix of ground truth class vs. predicted class."\n#| fig-alt: "Representation of a confusion matrix with entries \'TP\' when both \'True class y\' is \'+\'\' and \'Predicted Class yhat\' is \'+\', \'TN\' when both are \'-\', \'FP\' when True is \'-\' and Predicted is \'+\' and finally \'FN\' when True is \'+\' but Predicted is \'-\'.

Noticing preliminary inadequacies in those benchmarks, we embarked on a study to critically assess 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, using our novel unified evaluation framework through the lenses of people, process, and technology, under the pillars of benchmark functionality and integrity. Our research uncovered significant limitations, including biases, difficulties in measuring genuine reasoning, adaptability, implementation inconsistencies, prompt engineering complexity, evaluator diversity, and the overlooking of cultural and ideological norms in one comprehensive assessment. Our discussions emphasized the urgent need for standardized methodologies, regulatory certainties, and ethical guidelines in light of Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, including advocating for an evolution from static benchmarks to dynamic behavioral profiling to accurately capture LLMs’ complex behaviors and potential risks. Our study highlighted the necessity for a paradigm shift in LLM evaluation methodologies, underlining the importance of collaborative efforts for the development of universally accepted benchmarks and the enhancement of AI systems’ integration into society.\n\n###### Index Terms:\n\n## I Introduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), a sophisticated branch of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), have evolved from narrow, task-specific systems to versatile models capable of few-shot learning and handling diverse tasks [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib2)]. Evaluating LLMs is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations. Automatic evaluation methods, which employ standard metrics, offer computational efficiency, while human evaluations provide nuanced insights into the quality and accuracy of LLM responses [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib4)]. Recent advancements like GPT-4 and Gemini, with their multimodal capabilities, and Mistral 8x7B’s integration of Mixture of Experts (MoE), have enhanced LLMs’ ability to process specialized domain knowledge and reason across diverse tasks [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib2)]. The proliferation of over 700,000 LLMs on platforms like HuggingFace, alongside many publicly available commercial LLMs, has intensified competition among developers, driving the need for benchmarks to uniformly evaluate and compare LLM performance across dimensions such as accuracy, robustness, and reasoning, as these directly influence an LLM’s reliability in real-world applications [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. For example, an LLM that excels in accuracy but lacks robustness might fail when confronted with unexpected inputs or novel scenarios. Benchmarks serve as standardized sets of tasks or datasets that assess key aspects such as accuracy, efficiency, and ethical considerations like bias or fairness, guiding both development and deployment decisions [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. Widely used benchmarks, such as GLUE, SuperGLUE, and MMLU, are expected to enable consistent LLM evaluations, allowing researchers to fine-tune LLMs for specific tasks or domains, and facilitating performance comparisons across different models in real-world scenarios.\n\nUnlike the automobile and aviation industries, where clear regulations and well-defined public consensus guide benchmarking practices [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib5)], the advanced AI field lacks such universally accepted standards, leading many researchers to devise their own benchmarks. Benchmarks of LLMs, such as BIG-bench [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6)] by Google DeepMind and PromptBench [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] by Microsoft Research, have encompassed diverse methods, each with unique approaches and criteria, focusing mainly on exam-style or task-based assessments. Such methods, evaluating models’ abilities to perform specific functions or solve problems, typically emphasized tasks with predefined answers or scenarios with limited variability [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)]. Models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, perplexity, and F1-score on fixed datasets (e.g., [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10)]), or using human evaluators to measure “human-level” performance (e.g., [[11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12)]). The common approach of LLM benchmarking has often assumed a standardized “correct” answer or a marking rubric for each question, which LLMs are expected to reproduce, and the same benchmark sets are repeatedly used to compare and rank LLMs, ignoring their broader implications and real-world applicability. While providing insights, we believe this approach often fails to capture the subtleties and complexities of real-world use, as previous studies mainly focused on functionality within the technological context, neglecting processual and human aspects, especially the diversity of human values and cultures [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13)]. For instance, an LLM that performs well on standardized tasks may still struggle in contexts requiring cultural sensitivity, such as understanding sophisticated social interactions or ethical concerns in decision-making, which can vary significantly across different societies and user groups. Additionally, LLM benchmarks have often lacked a thorough examination, especially in evaluating LLMs’ full capabilities, limitations, and safety issues [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14)], highlighting the need for a more comprehensive and sophisticated approach. Evaluating LLMs and generative AI requires a method that assesses not only standardized task performance but also real-world applicability and safety, as a lack of such holistic evaluations can lead to LLMs that perform well in controlled environments but fail in critical real-world applications, posing risks such as perpetuating bias, making unsafe decisions, or being vulnerable to manipulation [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib2)].\n\nThis study was motivated by our concern over the rapid proliferation of LLM benchmark studies and the competition among them to establish superiority, often at the expense of well-rounded functionality and integrity assurance. When evaluating LLM benchmarks, two core aspects are critical for a reliable and unbiased evaluation of LLMs: functionality, which refers to how well a benchmark measures the specific capabilities of an LLM in alignment with real-world applications, and integrity, which ensures that the benchmark resists manipulation or gaming by models that exploit its criteria to produce misleading results. An inadequacy, in this context, refers to any deficiency or shortcoming in a benchmark’s ability to fully capture an LLM’s functionality or maintain its integrity during evaluation. Our preliminary observations indicated systemic inadequacies in most current LLM benchmarks, where superficial metrics often replaced comprehensive evaluations of LLM functionality and the assurance of benchmark integrity. As a result, many benchmarks failed to measure the complex, evolving capabilities of LLMs in real-world settings or address the risks of LLMs gaming and overfitting them. We propose a re-evaluation of current LLM benchmarking criteria, hypothesizing that a comprehensive evaluation framework must integrate both functionality and integrity, to provide a balanced, holistic, in-depth assessment of LLMs. This study aims to systematically analyze the inadequacies of current exam-style benchmarking in multimodal LLMs through the following research questions: (1) How can we identify, categorize, and explain the common inadequacies of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks? (2) Are these inadequacies evident in the popular benchmarks we have identified? (3) What should a comprehensive evaluation of LLM benchmarks include, considering both functionality and integrity for a complete understanding of LLM risks and societal impacts? Through this survey study, we propose a unified evaluation framework for LLM benchmarks, aligned with the domains of people, process, and technology, designed to facilitate a thorough examination of benchmarks. Our framework aims to enhance both functionality and integrity in benchmark design, guiding the development of more effective and secure LLM evaluation methods that reflect real-world applicability and ensure robust model development and deployment.\n\nThe major contributions of this study are as follows:\n\nWe proposed a unified evaluation framework for LLM benchmarks, based on the domains of people, process, and technology, as a foundation to comprehensively and holistically assess both the functionality and integrity of LLMs in real-world applications.\n\nUsing this framework, we conducted a systematic critique of 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, revealing key inadequacies and offering targeted methodological improvements to enhance the accuracy and fairness of LLM assessments.\n\nBuilding on the insights from our framework, we introduced an advanced evaluation method that extended traditional benchmarking with behavioral profiling and regular audits, creating a dynamic and ongoing assessment process that addressed evolving issues of real-world applicability, inclusivity, and security.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section [II](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S2 "II Background and Related Work ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence") offers a comprehensive analysis of prevalent benchmarks.

Finally, Section [IX](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S9 "IX Conclusion ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence") concludes the paper, summarizing the key findings and contributions.\n\n## II Background and Related Work\n\nBenchmarking is a critical process in computer science, serving as a standardized method to evaluate and compare the performance of hardware and software systems [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib15)]. This section reviews traditional benchmarking practices in computer science and contrasts them with the emerging challenges of benchmarking in generative AI and LLMs.\n\n### II-A Traditional Benchmarking in Computer Science\n\nIn computer science, benchmarking involves running a set of standardized tests on hardware or software systems to measure their performance under controlled conditions [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib15)]. Such benchmarks are designed to be repeatable and objective, allowing for fair comparisons between different systems or configurations. For instance, the SPEC CPU benchmark suite evaluates a processor’s ability to handle compute-intensive tasks by measuring execution times of standardized workloads [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib16)]. Standardization is essential in benchmarking to ensure consistency across evaluations, making the results reliable and widely accepted within the community [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib17)]. Benchmarking methodologies typically focus on specific performance metrics such as processing speed, memory bandwidth, or energy efficiency [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib18), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib15)]. Tools like Cinebench and 3DMark assess computational performance by performing intensive CPU or GPU tasks, which is critical for high-performance computing applications, and they help identify system bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts, contributing to advancements in hardware and software design [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib17), [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib18), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib15)]. The development of benchmarks requires careful consideration of workload representativeness to ensure that the tests reflect real-world usage scenarios [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib19)].\n\nHowever, traditional benchmarking faces challenges like benchmark manipulation, where systems are engineered to perform exceptionally well on specific benchmarks without delivering proportional real-world performance [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib20)]. For example, hardware manufacturers might optimize compilers or system settings to inflate benchmark scores, leading to misleading conclusions [[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib21)]. This has prompted calls for more robust and comprehensive benchmarking practices that can resist gaming and provide a true measure of system capabilities [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib22)]. Additionally, the reliability of benchmarking results in computer science and AI depends critically on their reproducibility, generalizability across different contexts, consistency over time, and objectivity in measurement, but at the same time, it raises the question of who holds the authority to set benchmark standards [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib22), [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib17)]. Consider that the same anti-malware products can score differently in tests like VB100, AV-Comparatives, and AV-Test, even when tests are administered around the same time, indicating variations in benchmarking criteria and evaluation methodologies [[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib23)]. Moreover, within the context of cybersecurity, our previous survey on ransomware revealed concerns about the self-benchmarking practices in many anti-ransomware studies, which often used diverse ransomware samples and methodologies and based their claims of superiority merely on higher detection rates [[24](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib24)]. This situation underscores the need for rigorous, comprehensive, and scientifically sound benchmarking practices that can provide reliable, meaningful and universally accepted comparisons.\n\n### II-B Benchmarking in Generative AI and LLMs\n\nBenchmarking in generative AI and LLMs introduces unique challenges that differ fundamentally from traditional computer science benchmarking. LLMs like Llama and GPT-4 are capable of understanding and generating human-like text, performing tasks ranging from translation to creative writing [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib4)]. Evaluating such models requires benchmarks that can assess not just quantitative performance, but also qualitative aspects like coherence, relevance, and ethical considerations [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. Unlike traditional benchmarks with clear numerical metrics, LLM benchmarking often involves subjective judgments and complex evaluation criteria [[25](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib25), [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13)]. LLM benchmarks commonly involve tasks such as language understanding, reasoning, and dialogue generation, using datasets like GLUE to provide standardized evaluation platforms [[26](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib26)]. However, the open-ended nature of language means that there can be multiple valid responses to a given prompt, complicating the assessment of correctness [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1)]. Furthermore, LLMs operate as black boxes with opaque internal mechanisms, making it difficult to interpret their decision-making processes and identify potential biases or ethical issues [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib27), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib4)]. This opacity poses risks when models generate harmful or biased content without transparent accountability mechanisms [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. For instance, an LLM used in a customer service chatbot might produce inappropriate or biased responses based on hidden internal biases, without any easy way to diagnose the underlying issue or improve the LLM’s behavior [[29](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib29)]. In high-stakes domains like healthcare or legal services, black-box LLMs could make critical errors without providing interpretable justifications, undermining trust and making it difficult to ensure the LLM’s safety or fairness [[30](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib30)]. The current LLM evaluation processes could vary significantly, involving text string comparisons for straightforward answers or relying on human judgment for more complex and subtle responses [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)].\n\nUnlike traditional benchmarks that are often static and hardware-focused, LLM benchmarking must account for the dynamic and evolving nature of language and societal norms [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31)]. LLMs can inadvertently learn and propagate biases present in training data, requiring benchmarks that can detect and mitigate such issues [[32](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib32)]. Additionally, LLMs may overfit to benchmark datasets, memorizing answers rather than demonstrating true understanding, which undermines the validity of the evaluation [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib33)]. The potential for data contamination, where test data leaks into training datasets, further complicates the benchmarking process [[34](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib34)]. Moreover, the global deployment of LLMs requires benchmarks that consider linguistic diversity and cultural nuances, moving beyond English-centric evaluations to include multiple languages and dialects, which contrasts with traditional benchmarks that are largely language-agnostic or focused on English [[35](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib35)]. Ethical considerations are also more pronounced in LLM benchmarking, as LLMs must navigate complex social norms and avoid generating inappropriate content [[36](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib36)]. The aforementioned factors require a multidisciplinary approach to LLM benchmarking, integrating insights from linguistics, ethics, and social sciences to create robust evaluation frameworks [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13), [30](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib30)].\n\n## III Unified Evaluation Framework for LLM Benchmarks\n\nIn this section, we developed a comprehensive framework to benchmark LLMs, grounded in principles of cybersecurity risk assessment. We based the framework on a thorough review of existing literature and best practices in the field, tailoring it to address the unique capabilities and challenges presented by generative AI especially LLMs. This framework was designed not only to assess technical performance but also to evaluate the broader applicability, robustness, and integrity of LLM benchmarks.\n\n### III-A Applying the People, Process, Technology (PPT) Framework\n\nThe People, Process, Technology (PPT) framework, widely used in cybersecurity, is also well-suited for evaluating LLM benchmarks due to its holistic approach, addressing not just technical factors, but also human and procedural elements [[37](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib37)]. While other frameworks (e.g., the Information Systems Success Model [[38](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib38)]) focus on narrower aspects, PPT is uniquely comprehensive, allowing for an in-depth assessment across multiple dimensions. This ensures a thorough evaluation of benchmarks, which require more than just technical soundness; they must also integrate human expertise and follow robust, adaptable processes. The PPT framework aligns with the core challenges of LLM benchmarking. Benchmarks involve complex interactions between developers, evaluators, and end-users (People), they must follow consistent and adaptable methodologies to remain relevant and resilient (Process), and they depend on scalable and reliable technical infrastructures (Technology) to accurately assess evolving LLM capabilities. The success of an LLM benchmark is not only in its ability to test specific tasks but also in how well it adapts to new challenges, handles real-world use cases, and resists manipulation or overfitting.\n\nPeople: The expertise and diversity of developers, evaluators, and end-users influence the validity and applicability of benchmark results. A lack of diversity in evaluators could bias results, making benchmarks less reflective of LLMs’ real-world performance across varied scenarios.\n\nProcess: Standardization and adaptability in benchmark construction and implementation are essential. Without well-defined processes, benchmarks may become outdated, inconsistent, or vulnerable to LLMs being optimized solely for specific test sets rather than demonstrating true capability.\n\nTechnology: The technical infrastructure supporting benchmarks, including algorithms, datasets, and evaluation metrics, must be scalable and robust. Technical limitations can impede the benchmark’s ability to provide accurate assessments, while ensuring the infrastructure’s scalability is critical as LLMs evolve and grow more complex.\n\nThe PPT framework thus provides a holistic lens to comprehensively evaluate LLM benchmarks, addressing both functionality and integrity. By integrating people, process, and technology, this framework allows for a more nuanced assessment compared to models that may overlook key aspects of LLM benchmarking. The PPT approach aligns with the need for multidisciplinary evaluation methods in complex AI systems, as highlighted in recent literature [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. Leveraging the PPT framework ensures our evaluation encompasses all necessary facets to produce reliable and meaningful insights into LLM performance and benchmarking practices.\n\n### III-B Functionality and Integrity in LLM Benchmarks\n\nWhen evaluating LLM benchmarks, two core aspects must be considered: functionality and integrity. Functionality assesses how well a benchmark measures the specific capabilities of LLMs, while integrity examines the benchmark’s resistance to manipulation or gaming by models that may exploit its criteria to achieve misleading results. Evaluating both functionality and integrity is essential to ensure that benchmarks provide a comprehensive and authentic assessment of LLMs, free from bias or manipulation.\n\nFunctionality Assessment: This determines if the benchmark accurately evaluates the intended capabilities of an LLM, such as reasoning, language comprehension, or multimodal integration. For instance, a benchmark should be designed to test the model’s true understanding rather than its ability to mimic expected answers. A counterexample is using benchmarks that rely on superficial elements like keyword matching, which can lead to overestimating an LLM’s language understanding when it simply exploits patterns without grasping the content. Functionality also considers the alignment of the benchmark with real-world applications, ensuring it tests skills relevant to practical use rather than artificial metrics.\n\nIntegrity Considerations: This involves assessing the robustness of the benchmark against potential exploitation by models tuned to optimize for specific evaluation metrics. For example, a benchmark lacking integrity might be susceptible to LLMs that achieve high scores through memorization of training data or by exploiting specific test set characteristics. An integrity breach occurs when LLMs appear to excel in benchmarks through these surface-level optimizations without demonstrating genuine capability. Ensuring integrity means the benchmark cannot be easily manipulated and that it provides a true reflection of an LLM’s performance, independent of prior exposure to similar tests or over-fitting strategies.\n\n### III-C Data Collection\n\nWe conducted a Structured Literature Review (SLR) to systematically identify relevant LLM benchmarks. Our focus was on benchmarks explicitly designed for evaluating large language models, particularly those with multimodal capabilities. The search encompassed peer-reviewed publications, prominent technical preprints, and widely cited benchmarking platforms up to October 2023.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nBenchmarks explicitly designed for LLM evaluation.\n\nBenchmarks covering a wide range of generative AI tasks, including language understanding, reasoning, coding, legal analysis, medical question answering, and tool usage.\n\nBenchmarks with substantial academic or technical adoption, indicated by citation counts or recognition in the AI community.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nBenchmarks that are too niche or focus on specialized tasks not representative of general LLM capabilities.\n\nBenchmarks lacking sufficient methodological detail for thorough evaluation.\n\n### III-D Data Analysis\n\nWe applied thematic analysis to systematically evaluate the selected benchmarks, focusing on identifying patterns of inadequacies in functionality and integrity. Our analysis aimed to determine whether the benchmarks accurately measured LLM capabilities without relying on superficial metrics or presentation nuances, and whether they could be manipulated by LLMs exploiting specific evaluation criteria. Our methodology involved the following steps:\n\nIdentification of Inadequacies: We critically reviewed each benchmark to identify potential inadequacies related to functionality and integrity, such as response variability, susceptibility to overfitting, and lack of consideration for linguistic diversity.\n\nCoding and Categorization: We coded the identified inadequacies and categorized them based on common themes, aligning with the domains of people, process, and technology as outlined in our unified evaluation framework.\n\nAssessment of Prevalence: We defined prevalence as the number of benchmarks (out of 23) exhibiting each specific inadequacy (except those resolved or not present). This metric quantifies the extent to which each inadequacy is present across the benchmarks.\n\nEvaluation of Benchmark Responses: For each identified inadequacy, we examined whether it was acknowledged or addressed by the benchmark creators. We categorized the benchmarks accordingly:\n\nPresent and Unacknowledged (marked as ✓): The inadequacy exists without recognition.\n\nAcknowledged but Unresolved (marked as △△\\triangle△): The inadequacy is recognized but not yet addressed.\n\nConsidered Addressed (marked as ×\\times×): The inadequacy has been recognized and mitigated.\n\nThe evaluation process is illustrated in Fig.\xa0[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S3.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ III-D Data Analysis ‣ III Unified Evaluation Framework for LLM Benchmarks ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence"), which guided our systematic assessment of each benchmark’s robustness and reliability.\n\n## IV Overview of LLM Benchmarks\n\nIn this section, we list the overview 23 LLM benchmarks we surveyed, including what they have achieved, and our preliminary findings.\n\n### IV-A LLM Benchmarks and Their Characteristics\n\nApplying such criteria of our Unified Evaluation Framework, we selected 23 LLM benchmarks that represented a diverse set of tasks and domains, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the LLM evaluation landscape. Table\xa0[I](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S4.T1 "TABLE I ‣ IV-A LLM Benchmarks and Their Characteristics ‣ IV Overview of LLM Benchmarks ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence") provides an overview of these benchmarks and their characteristics, categorized into general-purpose benchmarks and specialized-domain benchmarks.\n\nGeneral-purpose benchmarks primarily assess broad knowledge and reasoning across multiple domains.

HELM [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31)] from Stanford University compiled a benchmark collection to evaluate LLMs based on a metrics-driven approach in English. It covered 16 scenarios and 7 metrics, focusing on multi-metric measurement and dense evaluation across different tasks. PromptBench [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] from Microsoft focused on general knowledge, benchmarking LLMs using a collection of APIs, datasets, and models.

analysis, as summarised in Table [II](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S4.T2 "TABLE II ‣ IV-B Preliminary Findings Overview ‣ IV Overview of LLM Benchmarks ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence"), revealed widespread inadequacies across LLM benchmark studies, indicating the need for more refined and comprehensive evaluation practices to better assess the true capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs). A key observation is that many benchmarks predominantly focus on English, with limited representation of other languages, such as Simplified Chinese, and frequently neglect cultural and contextual variations in their questions and answers. This raises concerns about the generalizability of these benchmarks across diverse linguistic and cultural settings. For instance, benchmarks often assume singular correct answers in culturally nuanced questions, overlooking alternative valid responses from different cultural or religious perspectives, which limits the inclusivity of these evaluations. Another critical issue is that current benchmarks generally adopt task-based formats, such as Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and dialogue-based evaluations, which tend to be static and do not capture the evolving nature of human-AI interactions. Real-world LLM usage often involves continuous dialogues, yet many benchmarks assess only the first attempt of an LLM response, without considering the consistency and coherence of answers across multiple interactions. This focus on isolated responses reduces the relevance of these benchmarks in evaluating models designed for dynamic, ongoing interactions.\n\nOur review also found that only 6 of the 23 surveyed benchmark studies ([[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)]) were peer-reviewed at the time of this article, reflecting the early-stage nature of research in this domain. While preprints provide valuable insights, the lack of rigorous peer review raises questions about the scientific validity and reproducibility of many LLM benchmark results. Moreover, the speed of LLM output generation—a crucial factor for user experience in real-time applications—is frequently overlooked in current benchmarks, which tend to focus solely on the qualitative correctness of generated answers. Perhaps most concerning, many benchmarks failed to account for the possibility that LLMs can optimize their responses specifically to perform well on standardized tests, rather than genuinely demonstrating deep understanding or reasoning. This risk of ”benchmark gaming” undermines the integrity of evaluations, as models may be engineered to exploit the structure of the test rather than showcasing their full capabilities across diverse tasks. Given the rapid advancement of LLMs, it is imperative to develop evaluation practices that measure genuine reasoning skills and adaptability, rather than technical optimization for specific test formats. Our critique is grounded in published opinions and supported by our evaluative rationale, detailed in Sections [V](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S5 "V Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence"), [VI](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S6 "VI Processual Elements ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence"), and [VII](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S7 "VII Human Dynamics ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence"). The aim of this analysis is not to elevate any specific benchmark but to highlight common limitations that many benchmarks share. By addressing these issues, we seek to encourage the development of more robust, transparent, and representative benchmarks that better reflect the full range of LLM capabilities. The following sections provide an in-depth exploration of these findings, categorized into technological aspects, processual elements, and human dynamics.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|

in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")).\n\n### V-A Response Variability in Standardized Evaluations\n\nPrevalence: 22/23\n\nA significant inadequacy in LLM benchmarks is the response variability under standardized evaluations, especially when these benchmarks fail to account for LLMs tailored to specific formats or use cases. Despite the breadth of frameworks like [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)], they often overlook the subtle behaviors of LLMs designed for particular scenarios (Appendix [A-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS1 "A-A Response Variability in Standardized Evaluations ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Benchmarks that standardize formats without considering context-specific requirements can inadvertently skew the perceived functionality of these LLMs. For example, minor formatting changes in prompts, such as altering choice indicators from (A) to [A] or adding extra spaces, have been shown to shift response accuracy by approximately 5%, highlighting the LLMs’ sensitivity to superficial input variations [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)]. From a functionality perspective, this variability raises concerns about the accuracy of these benchmarks in measuring true model capabilities. If benchmarks fail to reflect the intended application context, they may mislead users and developers regarding the model’s practical performance, influencing deployment strategies inappropriately [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. Integrity concerns also arise when standardized benchmarks become predictable and exploitable, allowing LLMs to achieve artificially high scores through superficial optimization rather than genuine comprehension. This vulnerability to input sensitivity indicates a lack of robustness in the benchmarks, which could be exploited in practical applications, posing risks to system reliability and security [[54](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib54)]. To address such issues, LLM benchmark designs must be refined to accommodate the specificities of model architecture and intended use cases, ensuring they accurately capture the capabilities of LLMs in varied contexts. This approach will enhance the functionality and integrity of the evaluations, reducing the potential for misrepresentation and gaming of results, and ultimately leading to a more authentic assessment of LLM capabilities.\n\n### V-B Genuine Reasoning vs Technical Optimization\n\nPrevalence: 22/23\n\nThe challenge in distinguishing between responses driven by genuine reasoning and those resulting from technical optimization, such as overfitting to benchmark answers, was seen in [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [A-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS2 "A-B Genuine Reasoning vs Technical Optimization ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")), due to the opaque nature of LLMs, where the mechanisms behind their outputs are often not transparent. Consequently, LLMs can appear to demonstrate advanced reasoning when, in reality, they may simply be leveraging specific benchmark characteristics or exploiting superficial patterns. For example, an LLM trained on data that includes benchmark-like questions may produce correct answers by recognizing patterns rather than understanding the underlying concepts [[55](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib55), [53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)]. For example, HumanEval [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8)] evaluated Codex’s performance through functional correctness on programming problems, which might not fully capture the model’s reasoning capabilities across diverse real-world scenarios. Similarly, LegalBench [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14)] applied generic benchmarks to specialized legal reasoning tasks, potentially allowing LLMs to optimize for benchmark-specific patterns rather than demonstrating true legal comprehension that could include court negotiations.\n\nFrom a functionality perspective, this ambiguity undermines the benchmarks’ ability to accurately assess LLMs’ reasoning capabilities. If a benchmark fails to differentiate between true reasoning and optimization, it risks overestimating the model’s practical utility and cognitive abilities. A critical insight here is that benchmarks should be designed to probe deeper understanding rather than surface-level pattern recognition, ensuring that LLMs cannot succeed merely by exploiting familiar test elements. Regarding integrity, the inability to distinguish genuine reasoning from optimization raises concerns about the potential for LLMs to manipulate benchmark outcomes. LLMs that can achieve high scores through memorization or strategic over-fitting challenge the validity of the evaluation process. This issue is particularly problematic when benchmarks are inadvertently included in training data, allowing LLMs to produce artificially inflated results without demonstrating true competence [[55](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib55), [56](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib56)]. Addressing this requires designing benchmarks that are resistant to such exploitation, ensuring they accurately reflect the LLM’s ability to engage in authentic reasoning processes rather than optimized mimicry. To mitigate such challenges, benchmark designs must evolve to include tasks that require dynamic reasoning and adaptability, reducing the risk of LLMs gaming the system through technical optimizations. Continuous refinement and innovation in benchmark methodologies are essential to differentiate genuine reasoning from mere pattern exploitation, thereby providing a more reliable assessment of LLM capabilities.\n\n### V-C Tension Between Helpfulness and Harmlessness\n\nPrevalence: 19/23\n\nThe tension between helpfulness and harmlessness in LLM responses presents a significant challenge in benchmark evaluations, seen in [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [A-C](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS3 "A-C Tension Between Helpfulness and Harmlessness ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Human evaluations, such as A/B tests, often struggle to balance those two aspects, particularly in open-ended dialogues. For instance, MultiMedQA [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10)] assessed Flan-PaLM’s performance in medical question answering, revealing that while the model could provide accurate information, it occasionally failed to align with clinical consensus, indicating a struggle to balance helpfulness with the necessity of harmlessness in sensitive medical contexts. Similarly, LegalBench [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14)] evaluated LLMs on legal reasoning tasks, where the models needed to deliver precise legal information without overstepping into providing authoritative legal advice, thereby maintaining a balance between being helpful and avoiding potential legal ramifications. Such difficulty arises from the need to provide information without causing harm or controversy, a balance that is particularly delicate when addressing sensitive topics.\n\nFrom a functionality perspective, LLM benchmarks must accurately measure an LLM’s ability to provide informative yet harmless responses. This requires sophisticated evaluation criteria that distinguish between helpfulness in providing useful information and harmlessness in avoiding misinformation or offensive content. Benchmarks that fail to account for this balance risk either over-penalizing LLMs for providing valuable but sensitive information or underestimating the potential for harm in their responses [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. An insightful example is the evaluation of LLMs in the context of cybersecurity advice, where helpfulness could involve explaining malware analysis techniques, but doing so without risking the dissemination of potentially harmful information. Regarding integrity, benchmarks must be robust against LLMs that could exploit this tension to appear more capable [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. For instance, LLMs might evade challenging inquiries by refusing to respond, prioritizing harmlessness over helpfulness to avoid any potential controversy. This behavior could lead to a misleading assessment of the model’s abilities, giving the impression of ethical consideration when it may simply be avoiding complexity. To ensure integrity, benchmarks should test for situations where LLMs can demonstrate both helpfulness and harmlessness without compromising one for the other. Addressing this inadequacy requires developing benchmarks that incorporate high-level norms and values, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of how LLMs navigate this tension.\n\n### V-D Linguistic Variability and Embedded Logic Diversity\n\nPrevalence: 17/23\n\nCurrent LLM benchmarks often fail to account for the linguistic and logical diversity inherent in different languages, leading to an inadequate evaluation of LLMs’ true capabilities, as seen in [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12)] (Appendix [A-D](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS4 "A-D Linguistic Variability and Embedded Logic Diversity ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Predominantly English-centric benchmarks overlook the sophisticated reasoning patterns embedded within languages, when language structure can shape distinct cognitive processes [[57](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib57), [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. This lack of consideration results in benchmarks that wrongfully assume a uniform cognitive framework, failing to capture how LLMs handle linguistic variations across different cultures and languages [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13)].\n\nFrom a functionality perspective, this inadequacy undermines the benchmarks’ ability to evaluate LLMs in a multilingual context accurately. By not reflecting the cognitive diversity inherent in language structures, these benchmarks may misrepresent a model’s comprehension and reasoning capabilities. For instance, an LLM evaluated solely on English-centric benchmarks might appear proficient but could struggle to maintain accuracy and context in languages with different syntactic and semantic frameworks. This bias risks overestimating a model’s universality and applicability across languages. In terms of integrity, the oversight in linguistic variability can be exploited, as uneven moderation across languages may allow harmful or prohibited content to bypass detection in less moderated languages [[35](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib35)]. A model might score well on benchmarks in its primary language but fail to uphold the same standards in others, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities. Besides, a blend of different languages could sometimes be used to jailbreak LLMs without triggering LLM safety mechanisms like RLHF [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. Addressing such challenges requires benchmarks that recognize and adapt to linguistic diversity, testing LLMs on native language capabilities rather than relying on translation-based evaluations.\n\n### V-E Benchmark Installation and Scalability\n\nPrevalence: 16/23\n\nA key inadequacy in current LLM benchmarks is the challenge of installation and scalability, affecting their functional utility and integrity [[42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [A-E](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS5 "A-E Benchmark Installation and Scalability ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Many benchmarks demand considerable engineering effort to install and adapt to different computational environments, hindering broad accessibility and consistent evaluation across diverse LLMs. For example, SciBench [[46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46)] involved manual data extraction and complex problem formulations, further complicating the installation process. Moreover, scaling such benchmarks to handle larger LLMs or more extensive datasets often requires substantial infrastructure and resources, as reported by Anthropic [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)], posing a barrier to comprehensive and efficient assessments. For instance, APIBank [[50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50)] involved the complex implementation of 73 APIs, demanding extensive engineering efforts and resources to scale effectively.\n\nFrom a functionality standpoint, these technical hurdles delay and complicate the evaluation process, potentially limiting the ability to accurately measure LLM performance. For instance, if a benchmark cannot be efficiently scaled, it may fail to test an LLM’s capabilities under more demanding or realistic scenarios, resulting in an incomplete functional assessment. This limitation can lead to biased evaluations that do not fully represent an LLM’s operational capacities, especially for larger LLMs requiring more intensive testing environments. In terms of integrity, the difficulty in installing and scaling benchmarks can create inconsistencies in how LLMs are evaluated, opening the door to manipulation. If a benchmark is too complex to implement consistently, results may vary between environments, allowing LLMs to be selectively tested in conditions favorable to them. This lack of standardization can compromise the benchmark’s resistance to gaming by LLMs, undermining the reliability of its evaluation metrics. Improving the installation and scalability of benchmarks is crucial for ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and resistant to exploitation. Streamlined, well-documented benchmarks that can be easily deployed across different systems will enhance both the functional assessment of LLMs and the integrity of the evaluation process, enabling fairer and more accurate comparisons of model performance.\n\n### V-F Biases in LLM-Generated LLM Evaluations\n\nPrevalence: 9/23\n\nAn emerging concern in LLM benchmarks is the use of LLMs themselves to generate evaluation tasks or assess other LLMs, effectively acting as both creator and judge [[42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45)] (Appendix [A-F](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS6 "A-F Biases in LLM-Generated LLM Evaluations ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). This practice introduces the risk of amplifying inherent biases and inaccuracies present in the evaluating LLMs, which can significantly undermine the benchmark’s functionality and integrity. For instance, M3KE [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9)] utilized ChatGPT-generated multiple-choice questions to assess Chinese LLMs, inherently incorporating the biases of ChatGPT.\n\nFrom a functionality standpoint, such biases can distort the evaluation process, leading to inaccurate assessments of LLM capabilities. For instance, an LLM-generated benchmark might inadvertently favor certain types of responses or reasoning patterns, resulting in an overestimation or underestimation of the evaluated model’s performance [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1)]. This issue raises concerns about the benchmark’s ability to provide a true measure of an LLM’s diverse capabilities, potentially skewing its alignment with real-world applications. Regarding integrity, relying on LLMs for evaluation introduces the risk of circular reasoning, where the biases inherent in the LLMs generating the benchmarks could lead to evaluations that are not truly independent. This undermines the benchmark’s resistance to manipulation, as LLMs could exploit these biases to achieve misleadingly high scores. For example, if an LLM-generated benchmark unintentionally reinforces specific patterns or knowledge it was trained on, it may allow LLMs to perform well through pattern recognition rather than demonstrating genuine understanding or reasoning [[58](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib58), [56](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib56)]. To ensure both functionality and integrity, a more balanced approach that integrates human expertise is necessary. Human involvement can mitigate the biases introduced by LLM-generated content, ensuring a more rigorous and objective evaluation process. This hybrid approach would enhance the benchmark’s ability to provide a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of LLM capabilities, ensuring that evaluations remain reliable and reflective of true model performance.\n\n## VI Processual Elements\n\nThis section looks into the various process-related challenges and intricacies inherent in the implementation and evaluation of LLM benchmarks (Fig. [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S6.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ VI Processual Elements ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Please note that we use the word “Processual” to refer to the overall nature and development of processes, instead of “procedural” which focuses on specific steps or methods.\n\n### VI-A Inconsistent Benchmark Implementation\n\nPrevalence: 18/23\n\nA critical issue identified in LLM benchmarks is the inconsistency in implementation across different research teams, as observed in [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [B-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A2.SS1 "B-A Inconsistent Benchmark Implementation ‣ Appendix B Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Processual Elements ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Variations in the interpretation and execution of benchmarks, including differences in few-shot learning setups or chain-of-thought prompting, have led to diverse results that challenge the uniformity and reliability of these evaluations. For example, benchmarks like MMLU showed significant score variations due to differing implementation strategies [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)]. Similarly, M3KE [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9)] required substantial customization to accommodate language-specific subtleties, leading to inconsistencies in assessing Chinese LLMs across different research environments.\n\nFunctionally, this inconsistency hampers the benchmarks’ ability to provide a uniform, objective assessment of LLMs. The lack of standardization in implementation can result in skewed outcomes, making it difficult to compare LLMs fairly or derive meaningful insights into their performance [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)]. This undermines the benchmarks’ functionality, as the results become less reliable for comparative analysis or performance tracking across different LLMs. From an integrity perspective, such inconsistencies can introduce vulnerabilities in the evaluation process. The absence of standardized implementation protocols opens up opportunities for manipulation or biased interpretations, where variations in methodology could be exploited to produce favorable outcomes without reflecting the model’s genuine capabilities [[55](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib55), [56](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib56)]. This compromises the benchmark’s integrity, as differing approaches might obscure true performance or create loopholes that can be exploited. To address such concerns, establishing standardized protocols and guidelines for benchmark implementation is essential. A uniform approach would enhance the consistency and reliability of LLM evaluations, ensuring that benchmarks provide a fair and accurate reflection of model capabilities.\n\n### VI-B Slow Test Iteration Time\n\nPrevalence: 18/23\n\nSlow iteration time is a key inadequacy in LLM benchmarks, particularly in comprehensive third-party frameworks like BIG-bench and HELM [[40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [B-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A2.SS2 "B-B Slow Test Iteration Time ‣ Appendix B Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Processual Elements ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). These frameworks often involve extensive evaluation processes, which can span weeks or months, hindering timely feedback on new LLMs. External involvement in evaluations adds further delays, requiring coordination and engineering support, as seen in benchmarks like BIG-bench [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6)] and HELM [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31)]. The need for comprehensive testing across diverse scenarios inherently extends evaluation time.\n\nFunctionally, prolonged iteration times hinder the benchmarks’ ability to provide current insights into LLM performance. For instance, SciBench [[46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46)] involved manual data extraction and complex problem formulations, which significantly extended the evaluation process, making it difficult to keep pace with the rapid advancements in LLM development. With AI advancing rapidly, an LLM may undergo significant updates during its evaluation period, potentially rendering the results outdated or irrelevant by the time they are published [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib2)]. From an integrity perspective, slow iteration times pose security risks. Delayed evaluations mean emerging threats or vulnerabilities in LLMs may go undetected for extended periods, exposing systems to potential exploitation [[59](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib59), [54](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib54)]. For example, ToolBench [[48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48)] integrated LLMs with a vast number of software APIs, requiring extensive manual configuration and adaptation, which could delay the identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the lag in benchmark feedback to LLMs would limit the ability to promptly address identified issues, allowing weaknesses to persist longer than necessary. To mitigate such challenges, streamlining evaluation processes and improving coordination with external parties is crucial. However, aligning the need for thorough evaluation with the rapid development pace of AI remains a complex issue, requiring innovative solutions to balance depth and timeliness in LLM benchmarking.\n\n### VI-C Challenge of Proper Prompt Engineering in Benchmarking\n\nPrevalence: 14/23\nPrompt engineering plays a crucial role in evaluating LLMs, as it shapes the interaction between the model and the test. While exploring different prompts is valuable for understanding LLM behavior, in the context of benchmarking, it is important to ensure that prompts are designed to accurately and consistently assess the LLM’s capabilities. Challenges can arise when variations in prompt formulation lead to significant differences in model performance, which can complicate the interpretation of benchmark results [[40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45)] (Appendix [B-C](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A2.SS3 "B-C Challenge of Proper Prompt Engineering ‣ Appendix B Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Processual Elements ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). For example, MMLU [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39)] employed a variety of prompts across different subjects to assess knowledge, but inconsistencies in prompt phrasing could lead to overestimation of the LLM’s capabilities in certain areas.\n\nFrom a functionality perspective, inconsistency in prompt design can lead to assessments that do not accurately reflect the model’s true capabilities. For example, prompts that are overly leading or ambiguous may result in responses that either overestimate or underestimate the LLM’s performance, and this variability can make it difficult to compare results across different models or studies [[60](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib60)]. Regarding integrity, if benchmarks do not standardize prompt construction, there is a risk that LLMs could be fine-tuned or engineered to perform well on specific prompt styles, potentially compromising the fairness of the evaluation [[35](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib35), [54](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib54)]. To address such challenges, it is essential for benchmarks to adopt careful prompt engineering practices that aim for clarity, neutrality, and consistency, thereby ensuring that the evaluation accurately captures the model’s capabilities without introducing unintended biases.\n\n## VII Human Dynamics\n\nThis section explores the subtle complexities of human factors influencing LLM benchmarks (Fig. [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S7.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ VII Human Dynamics ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")).\n\n### VII-A Diversity in Human Curators and Evaluators\n\nPrevalence: 19/23\n\nThe heterogeneity among human curators and evaluators significantly impacts the construction and assessment of LLM benchmarks. Even with standardized guidelines, differences in cultural, religious, political, and academic or commercial backgrounds can introduce inconsistencies, particularly in subjective evaluations where linguistic and interpretative diversity play a role. This challenge was evident in benchmarks involving human judgment, such as those relying on sophisticated response evaluation or red-teaming (for cybersecurity purposes) [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [C-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A3.SS1 "C-A Diversity in Human Curators and Evaluators ‣ Appendix C Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Human Dynamics ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")).\n\nFrom a functionality perspective, this diversity can lead to subjective biases in benchmark construction and evaluation. For instance, cultural nuances can result in varying interpretations of responses, affecting the consistency and objectivity of the assessment [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53), [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1)]. For instance, LegalBench [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14)] utilized legal professionals from diverse jurisdictions to evaluate LLMs’ legal reasoning, yet the varying interpretations of legal principles across different regions could skew the results and lead to inconsistent assessments, making it difficult to ensure a uniform evaluation standard across different LLMs. Regarding integrity, inconsistent application and interpretation by diverse evaluators can open avenues for manipulation or biased outcomes. Disparities in evaluation criteria might allow LLMs to exploit certain nuances to achieve favorable results, undermining the benchmark’s robustness and trustworthiness [[59](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib59)]. This inconsistency can make it challenging to safeguard against potential biases or exploitation within the evaluation process. Addressing such issue requires a careful balance between leveraging diverse perspectives and ensuring consistency in evaluation. While diversity among evaluators enriches the assessment process, standardized protocols and training are necessary to minimize subjective biases and enhance the reliability of LLM benchmarks.\n\n### VII-B Diverse Cultural, Social, Political, Religious, and Ideological Norms\n\nPrevalence: 18/23\n\nLLM benchmarks face the inherent challenge of encompassing a wide range of cultural, religious, political, and ideological norms [[40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [C-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A3.SS2 "C-B Diverse Cultural, Social, Political, Religious and Ideological Norms ‣ Appendix C Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Human Dynamics ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Given that humans often disagree on fundamental issues, including interpretations of universal principles like human rights, pursuing a universal benchmark that addresses all cultural and ideological perspectives may be unrealistic. Benchmarks that rely on standardized answers or rubrics can inadvertently clash with diverse values, highlighting the impossibility of creating a one-size-fits-all evaluation. For example, LegalBench [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14)], with its focus on American legal reasoning, may overestimate its applicability across diverse global legal contexts. Conversely, the integrity of Simplified Chinese LLM benchmarks like C-Eval [[43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43)] can be easily gamed by specific prompt structures or leverage training data tailored to the Simplified Chinese context, such as offering responses that align with or praise Chinese ideologies, to achieve artificially high scores without demonstrating genuine understanding or reasoning [[61](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib61)].\n\nFunctionally, this diversity means that benchmarks may struggle to fairly and accurately evaluate LLMs across varying viewpoints. An LLM’s response to sensitive topics might be deemed appropriate in one cultural context but controversial in another [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13), [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. This inconsistency challenges the creation of benchmarks that can impartially assess LLMs’ ability to navigate complex societal norms. An example of compromising benchmark integrity could be when benchmarks are tailored to avoid controversy (saying what people want to hear), leading to superficial assessments that do not truly evaluate the LLM’s ability to handle subtle or sensitive topics, thereby allowing LLMs to appear more competent than they actually are in real-world scenarios [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. However, LLM providers and benchmark assessors are faced with the difficult decision of potentially offending some individuals, regardless of whether they aim for inclusivity or specificity. This is not a failure on their part, but rather an acknowledgment of the inherently subjective nature of humanity norms. Given such complexities, it may be more pragmatic for researchers to focus on context-specific benchmarks rather than striving for a universal standard benchmark for all human norms.\n\n## VIII Discussions\n\nThis section provides a comprehensive discussion of the underlying causes that have resulted in the previously aforementioned inadequacies in current LLM benchmarking methods.\n\n### VIII-A Misuse of the Term “Benchmark”\n\nThe term “benchmark”, which should mean to the process of evaluating and comparing the performance of LLMs using standardized tests and metrics, has been applied more liberally in academic publishing than warranted, reflecting the evolving stage of AI regulatory compliance and public consensus on generative AI’s emerging role and impact. Consequently, a wide array of non-standardized LLM test sets have been self-declared as LLM benchmarks, often lacking the rigor and uniformity required for true benchmarking. Genuine benchmarks should provide standardized, comprehensive evaluations, distinguishing them from more informal assessments rooted in researchers’ subjective perspectives. Many so-called benchmarks serve merely as initial test sets tailored to specific LLM tasks, often falling short in integrity and functionality. Unlike fields such as automotive or aviation, where benchmarks are guided by established regulations and public consensus, the AI domain remains largely unregulated and in flux. This has led researchers to create varied task sets and questions, adding complexity to LLM evaluation and potentially misguiding interpretations of these sets as complete assessments of LLM capabilities. While such efforts contribute to the evolving landscape of LLM evaluation, highlighting the need for evolving standards, they also demonstrate the urgency for structured, universally accepted benchmarking frameworks. We believe that effective LLM benchmarks should rigorously assess functionality while being resilient to manipulation, ensuring they accurately reflect true model capabilities rather than superficial optimizations. The current research landscape requires benchmarks that align with emerging regulatory mandates and societal needs, particularly as LLMs become increasingly integrated into various aspects of life. Through rigorously designed benchmarks, we can ensure the accurate assessment of LLMs’ growing capabilities, guiding their responsible development and deployment.\n\n### VIII-B Assessment Limitations for Reasoning and Multimodality\n\nCurrent LLM benchmarks exhibit significant limitations in both functionality and integrity when assessing comprehensive reasoning and multimodal capabilities. Functionally, many benchmarks fail to evaluate the depth of LLMs’ reasoning and multimodal integration because they primarily focus on text-based tasks, neglecting the intricate processing required for integrating visual, auditory, and other sensory data [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib2)]. This narrow focus often results in benchmarks that assess only surface-level performance, without engaging the models in scenarios that require true multimodal understanding or complex reasoning. For example, benchmarks that rely on simple question-answer formats may inadvertently assess a model’s ability to recall learned patterns rather than its capacity for creative problem-solving, thereby conflating crystal (recalled knowledge) and fluid (creative problem-solving) intelligence. In terms of integrity, such benchmarks are vulnerable to being manipulated by LLMs that have been overfitted to specific datasets or tuned to exploit particular evaluation metrics, when benchmarks allow models to achieve high scores through memorization or pattern exploitation rather than demonstrating genuine capability. For instance, a model trained on benchmark-specific data can deliver seemingly impressive results without possessing the underlying understanding or adaptability required in real-world applications. Consequently, current benchmarks may provide misleading assessments of LLM capabilities, due to superficial optimization strategies [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)].\n\n### VIII-C Unpredictability and Non-Repeatability\n\nThe rapid evolution of commercial and open source LLMs introduces significant unpredictability and non-repeatability in benchmark assessments. From a functionality standpoint, the frequent updates and model variations released by vendors make it difficult to ascertain whether a benchmark measures an LLM’s core capabilities or merely reflects transient optimizations tailored to the latest version. This instability undermines the benchmark’s ability to consistently evaluate reasoning, comprehension, or multimodal integration, as the results may vary with each model iteration. Regarding integrity, the evolving nature of LLMs opens avenues for potential manipulation, as vendors can modify models to perform well on known benchmarks without genuinely improving underlying capabilities. This dynamic can lead to misleadingly high benchmark scores that do not represent the LLM’s true functional performance in diverse, real-world scenarios. The lack of stable benchmarks complicates efforts to ensure that evaluations remain impartial and unaffected by superficial enhancements, thereby raising concerns about the authenticity of the assessments. Such issues require universally accepted, adaptable benchmarking frameworks that can accommodate the rapid advancements in LLM and generative AI, while providing reliable, repeatable measures of LLM performance. Without such standards, the evaluation landscape risks becoming fragmented and inconsistent, impeding the ability to accurately gauge the evolving capabilities of LLMs.\n\n### VIII-D Knowledge Boundaries in AI Benchmarking\n\nLLM benchmarks are constrained by the current limits of the benchmark creators’ human knowledge, hindering their ability to fully assess and cultivate emerging AI capabilities that may surpass conventional human understanding, potentially stalling innovation in fields that rely on advanced AI insights [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib4)]. Additionally, the lack of specialized domain knowledge among benchmark evaluators can compromise the benchmark integrity, as generalist approaches often fail to address the subtle requirements of critical sectors such as national security or healthcare. Such deficiency not only introduces benchmarking biases, but also creates vulnerabilities, allowing LLMs to take advantage of “benchmarks” created by people who do not fully understand the specific field. To address such challenges, benchmarks must evolve to include a broader knowledge base and involve evaluators with deep expertise in specialized fields, which is crucial for creating assessments that genuinely reflect the advanced capabilities of LLMs and possibly soon Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and are robust against manipulation. The rapid progression of LLMs requires LLM benchmarks that are as innovative and adaptable as the systems they evaluate, ensuring accurate measurement of LLM functionalities while maintaining integrity against evolving AI threats. Developing such benchmarks requires a concerted effort to integrate domain-specific knowledge into the evaluation process, ensuring that the assessments remain relevant and resilient in the face of AI’s advancing frontier.\n\n### VIII-E Challenges in Inclusive Benchmarking\n\nStandardizing benchmarks for LLMs faces significant challenges due to the diversity of human values and perspectives, which extend beyond linguistic, cultural, religious, and political realms to encompass a broad spectrum of societal norms and ethical considerations, and are sometimes conflicting and irreconcilable. The predominance of English and Simplified Chinese (overlooking Traditional Chinese differences) in those benchmarks frequently reflected the default values and beliefs of their creators, overlooking the pluralistic nature of global beliefs and practices. For example, the English and Simplified Chinese centrism in benchmarks like BIG-Bench [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6)], and the focus on crystallized knowledge in MultiMedQA [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10)] and ARB [[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41)], highlighted such challenges, potentially disadvantaging LLMs not trained in those more prevalent languages and limiting assessments of their broader reasoning capabilities. Such a narrower focus would compromise the benchmarks’ ability to comprehensively and holistically evaluate LLMs, potentially favoring LLMs that aligned with specific cultural or ideological norms at the expense of broader applicability and acceptance, and raising concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs in the absence of cultural and ideological inclusivity. The reliance on standardized answers or rubrics exacerbated this issue, especially in assessments designed to gauge fairness, societal appropriateness, or ethical decision-making, where the rich tapestry of human diversity demanded a more sophisticated approach. Addressing the aforementioned challenges would require moving beyond technical fixes to incorporate ethical decision-making and cultural sensitivity, highlighting the need for benchmarks that facilitate the development of globally aware LLMs, acknowledging the vast array of human values [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13)]. As the development of future LLM benchmarks progresses, it is anticipated that many will encounter similar challenges, particularly when the diversity of benchmark creators, evaluators, or the content itself does not fully embrace the broad spectrum of human diversity. However, different jurisdictions, religions, or cultures may have varying interpretations of inclusivity, ethics, or societal fairness that could lead to disagreements on what constitutes a superior LLM, which extends beyond technical benchmarks into broader considerations of values and politics.\n\n### VIII-F Limitations of This Study\n\nThis study, while aiming to provide a thorough critique of LLM benchmarks, encounters its own set of limitations. Firstly, our analysis inherently carries our subjective bias, a challenge we have attempted to mitigate by transparently listing our evaluative rationale in the Appendices. Due to the varying level of detail in benchmark descriptions, when we could not conclusively determine whether a study had acknowledged or addressed a specific benchmark inadequacy, or evaluate the correctness of questions and answers (which themselves could become outdated as technology and modern civilization evolves, and the study in [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)] found mislabeled or unanswerable examples within MMLU [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39)]), we opted to give these studies the benefit of the doubt, acknowledging the potential for possible oversight. Secondly, while only 5 out of the 23 surveyed benchmark studies were peer-reviewed, our critical inclusion of preprints should not be seen as diminishing their scientific contribution, although it highlighted the evolving and dynamic nature of research in this field. Thirdly, our decision not to attempt reproducing results from the surveyed benchmark studies, was informed by the substantial time and effort required, coupled with the challenge of LLM updates potentially altering outcomes during the lengthy evaluation process. Furthermore, while we addressed linguistic differences between Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese, we did not explore the subtle distinctions among various English dialects (e.g., American, British) and their inherent logical differences related to cultural attitudes, thereby acknowledging another layer of complexity in language-based evaluations. Lastly, the absence of specific regulations and guidelines for generative AI and LLMs, and a lack of public consensus on acceptable AI behaviors, constrained our ability to definitively enumerate all benchmark inadequacies. The evolving capabilities of advanced AI systems would require ongoing amendments to our critique, reflecting the dynamic nature of the field and the continuous emergence of new AI features.\n\n### VIII-G Future Research Direction: Extending Benchmarks with Behavioral Profiling and Regular Audits\n\nTo effectively evaluate and utilize LLMs amid the swift advancements in generative AI, their evaluation methods can be extended beyond traditional benchmarks to include both initial screenings and in-depth, ongoing assessments that align with changing technological and societal needs. Similar to the initial candidate selection and aptitude tests in the human recruitment process, traditional benchmarks can serve as the first filter to screen out LLMs that fail to meet basic competence levels, akin to identifying candidates who might be fraudulent, incompetent, non-compliant or otherwise unsuitable. This step ensures that only LLMs with a foundational level of proficiency and regulatory compliance proceed to more rigorous evaluations, optimizing resource allocation for subsequent stages of the assessment process.\n\nMirroring the interview stage of candidate selection, behavioral profiling explores deeper into the subtleties of LLM performance by assessing models beyond mere task completion, examining adaptability, ethical reasoning, and creativity in scenarios reflecting real-world complexities. Such AI behavioral analysis and profiling, a topic for future research, will prioritize LLMs most likely to fulfill specific roles or tasks, providing a sophisticated understanding of model capabilities and informing better selection decisions for deployment in sensitive or critical applications. Echoing the probation period in employment, regular audits post-deployment serve to continuously assess LLM performance against evolving standards and expectations. This step is crucial for catching any discrepancies between initial evaluations and actual performance, ensuring LLMs remain aligned with the requirements and ethical standards of evaluators and regulators over time. However, there are certain methodological limitations inherent in our approach. The subjective nature of benchmark evaluations, particularly when assessing more abstract qualities like adaptability or ethical reasoning, introduces potential bias. Additionally, the exclusion of certain benchmarks or evaluation frameworks may limit the generalizability of our findings. Future studies should address these gaps by exploring more objective, quantifiable methods for behavioral profiling and expanding the scope to include underrepresented benchmarks.\n\nGiven the rapid advancements in AI, our analysis risks becoming outdated as LLMs and benchmarking practices evolve. This highlights the need for ongoing research to continuously refine both the criteria and methods for LLM evaluation, ensuring they remain relevant and reflective of real-world complexities. Future research should focus on developing dynamic benchmarking systems that adapt to these changes, incorporating real-time audits and frequent updates to evaluation standards to capture the full scope of LLM capabilities and risks. Implementing this comprehensive evaluation framework will require collaboration across academia, industry, and regulatory bodies to develop standardized methodologies and ethical guidelines for each stage, ensuring assessments are rigorous and reflective of societal values and technological advancements. This will facilitate the creation of a dynamic evaluation ecosystem capable of adapting to the rapid pace of AI innovation and ensuring deployed LLMs are both effective and secure.\n\n## IX Conclusion\n\nThis study has critically analyzed 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, exposing significant inadequacies across technological, processual, and human dynamics that compromise their accuracy and reliability. The lack of standardized frameworks in AI benchmarking, unlike the established practices in regulated industries, has led to a proliferation of researcher-defined benchmarks that inadequately capture the complexity and evolving nature of LLMs. Our key contributions include: (i) formulating a unified evaluation framework rooted in cybersecurity principles to systematically identify and address deficiencies in benchmark design, focusing on functionality and integrity; (ii) conducting a detailed critique of 23 prominent LLM benchmarks, highlighting widespread issues that could impair comprehensive LLM assessment; and (iii) proposing the integration of LLM behavioral profiling and regular audits to enhance evaluation methodologies. As we arguably edge closer to the realization of AGI-like capabilities, it becomes crucial to rectify such benchmarking deficiencies, to ensure the responsible and secure deployment of LLMs. Furthermore, the lack of research consensus on how to properly benchmark LLMs, coupled with the academic liberty of releasing preprints, is likely to lead to a continued influx of question-and-answer sets self-claimed as benchmarks. It is therefore critical to point out their limitations and encourage deeper reflection within the research community. Our proposed extension of benchmarks with behavioral profiling and audits can provide a more subtle and rigorous evaluation of LLM capabilities and risks. Future work should prioritize the development of such benchmarks and establish standardized evaluation guidelines. We advocate for an international collaborative effort involving academia, industry, and regulatory bodies to continuously refine LLM benchmarks, aligning them with technological advancements and societal needs to ensure the development of robust and trustworthy AI systems.\n\n## References\n\n## Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects\n\n### A-A Response Variability in Standardized Evaluations\n\nPrevalence: 22/23\n\nMMLU [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39)]: The study designed a benchmark that focused on a wide range of tasks across different fields, like Professional Law and College Medicine.

The study did not indicate any acknowledgment of this benchmark inadequacy nor attempts to address it.\n\n![Mascot Sammy](data:image/png;base64,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)'), SearchResult(url='https://www.evidentlyai.com/blog/rag-benchmarks', title='7 RAG benchmarks', raw_content='![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2747cf_vector.svg)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/66180fbf4f40e9ed73ca2d39_evidently_ai_logo_fi.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/67d2624dc76fe4c62697aff8_chats-teardrop-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### LLM Testing Platform\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/67d3354a454c59d5f7affee2_list-magnifying-glass-duotone%20(3).svg)\n\n##### RAG Testing\n\n![Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/664abdb798a210c5d2640337_lightbulb-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### LLM Evaluation Advisory\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/67d33514b0f63efed5f253e9_crosshair-simple-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### Adversarial Testing\n\n![Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/6650a6bcbdd0a756edf0d829_chart-bar-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### ML Monitoring\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/67c9a94702f76fd53c7983b6_tree-structure-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### AI Agent Testing\n\n![Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/664abdb7ee755c4dc43cefc2_users-three-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### Open-Source\n\n##### See Evidently in action\n\n![Evidently AI Testing for LLM](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/663511956e05f300480f19fd_llm_2.png)\n![Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27473e_Group%209.svg)\n![book](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/664abba265e01ed75b39988c_book-duotone.svg)\n\n##### Blog\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/675a45076643cf7042075aac_star-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### LLM benchmarks\n\n![Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/664abdb7fbdd19d6d3f1875c_code-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### Tutorials\n\n![Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/664abdb798a210c5d2640337_lightbulb-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### ML and LLM system design\n\n![Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/664abdb798a210c5d2640368_check-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### Guides\n\n![Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/664abdbd5bfc045c59b3467f_gear-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### ML and AI platforms\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/6864161170dcaff6e135b204_video-duotone.svg)\n\n##### Courses\n\n![Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/664abdb7ee755c4dc43cefc2_users-three-duotone%20(1).svg)\n\n##### Community\n\n##### LLM evaluation for AI builders: applied course\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/680a5f99dc31c1839709a464_robot-gets-a-health-check%20(3)-min.png)\n![Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27473e_Group%209.svg)\n![Icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc2746d7/664abe8f5bd7dda2d12a1e6d_list-bold.svg)\n\n###### Community\n\n# 7 RAG benchmarks\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/681a2c70661f1f94283bd195_rag%20benchmarks-min.png)\n\ncontents**â\x80\x8d**\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular technique for grounding the outputs of large language models (LLMs) in reliable, context-specific data. By pulling in relevant information from trusted data sources, RAG helps reduce [hallucinations](https://www.evidentlyai.com/blog/llm-hallucination-examples), improve response accuracy, and enable source-backed and personalized answers.\n\nRAG is already powering a wide range of [real-world systems](https://www.evidentlyai.com/blog/rag-examples), from customer support bots to fraud investigation tools. As adoption grows, so does the need to evaluate these systems effectively.Â\n\nIn this blog, we highlight seven RAG benchmarks that help measure and compare how well different LLMs handle core RAG challenges like large context windows, grounded reasoning, and using retrieved evidence effectively.\n\n## NeedleInAHaystack (NIAH)\n\nThe [Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH)](https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack) test, first proposed by [Greg Kamradt](https://gregkamradt.com/), is a simple yet powerful method for testing the in-context retrieval ability of long context LLMs. It tests whether a model can successfully retrieve a small, planted piece of information (the â\x80\x9cneedleâ\x80\x9d) hidden in an extensive collection of irrelevant data (the â\x80\x9chaystackâ\x80\x9d). The model is asked a question that can only be answered correctly by finding and using that specific information. Evaluation is straightforward: whether the model can retrieve it accurately. You can also iterate over various document depths, where the needle is placed, and context lengths to measure performance.Â\n\nInitially, Paul Graham\'s essays were used as a â\x80\x9chayâ\x80\x9d where a random statement â\x80\x93 â\x80\x9cThe best thing to do in San Francisco is to go to Dolores Park and eat a sandwich on a sunny dayâ\x80\x9d â\x80\x93 was placed to perform the test. However, you can use any data corpus as a long context window to run the test.Â\n\n![Needle In A Haystack test results](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/681a279306acdd020039fe0f_GPT_4_testing.png)\n\n##### **[fs-toc-omit]200 LLM benchmarks**\n\n## BeIRÂ\n\n[BeIR (Benchmarking Information Retrieval)](https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir) evaluates retrieval models across diverse datasets and tasks. It tests the ability of models to find relevant documents, focusing on zero-shot and domain-agnostic evaluation.Â\n\nBeIR includes 18 datasets across 9 task types, including fact checking, duplicate detection, question answering, augment retrieval, and retrieval from forums. The benchmark also allows testing retrieval abilities across diverse domains, from generic ones like news or Wikipedia to highly specialized ones such as biomedical scientific publications. BeIR can evaluate various retrieval systems, such as dense and sparse retrievers, hybrid models, and re-ranking systems.Â\n\n**Example questions:**\n\n![Tasks and datasets in the BeIR benchmark](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/681a27e274624f5ca43cf86b_beir-min.png)\n\n## FRAMES\n\n[FRAMES (Factuality, Retrieval, And reasoning MEasurement Set)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/frames-benchmark) offers a unified framework for assessing LLM performance in end-to-end RAG scenarios. It tests RAG systems across three dimensions: factuality, retrieval accuracy, and reasoning.Â\n\nThe dataset comprises over 800 test samples with challenging multi-hop questions that require the integration of information from 2-15 Wikipedia articles to answer. FRAMES questions also cover different reasoning types needed to answer the question, including numerical, tabular, and temporal reasoning, multiple constraints, and post-processing.Â\n\n**Example questions:**\n\n![Example question from FRAMES benchmark](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/681a2835b48da5afb6eaa103_frames-min.png)\n\n## RAGTruth\n\n[RAGTruth](https://github.com/ParticleMedia/RAGTruth) is a benchmark that helps to evaluate the extent of hallucination in RAG systems. It is tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations and comprises 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using RAG. The benchmark distinguishes between four types of hallucinations:Â\n\nRAGTruth can be used to assess both hallucination frequencies in different models and the effectiveness of hallucination detection methodologies.Â\n\n![RAGTruth data gathering pipeline](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/681a288ef5fe5ec4a9225546_ragtruth-min.png)\n\n## RULER\n\n[RULER](https://github.com/NVIDIA/RULER) extends the original NeedleInAHaystack (NIAH) test by varying the number and types of "needles" (target information) within large contexts. It tests LLMs across four task categories: retrieval, multi-hop tracing, aggregation, and question answering.Â\n\nRULER is a synthetic benchmark. It automatically generates evaluation examples based on input configurations of sequence length and task complexity.Â\n\n![Task examples with flexible configurations in RULER](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/681a28d4661f1f942839689b_ruler-min.png)\n\n## MMNeedle\n\n[Multimodal Needle in a Haystack (MMNeedle)](https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/multimodal-needle-in-a-haystack) evaluates the long-context capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It tests the ability of MLLMs to locate a target sub-image (the â\x80\x9cneedleâ\x80\x9d) within a set of images (the â\x80\x9chaystackâ\x80\x9d) based on textual descriptions.\n\nThe benchmark covers diverse settings with varying context lengths and single and multiple needles. It includes 40,000 images, 560,000 captions, and 280,000 needle-haystack pairs. MMNeedle also employs image stitching to further increase the input context length.\n\n![MMNeedle evaluation overview](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/681a291e53acbf0618220798_mmneedle-min.png)\n\n## FEVER\n\n[FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification)](https://github.com/awslabs/fever) is a publicly available dataset for verification against textual sources. It is designed to test a systemâ\x80\x99s ability to fact-check claims using evidence from Wikipedia. It includes over 185,000 human-generated claims based on Wikipedia articles and labeled as Supported, Refuted, or Not Enough Info. A model is given a claim (e.g., â\x80\x9cThe Eiffel Tower is in Berlinâ\x80\x9d), and must then retrieve Wikipedia sentences relevant to this claim and determine the correct label.Â\n\nThe benchmark evaluates information retrieval, evidence selection, and reasoning capabilities. FEVER can be used to assess RAG pipelines and LLMs\' ability to avoid hallucination and reason with evidence.\n\n**Example claims:**\n\n![Example claim from the FEVER benchmark](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/681a295814b4245eaeab49bf_fever-min.png)\n\n## Test your RAG system with Evidently\n\nWhile benchmarks help compare models, your RAG system needs [custom evaluations](https://www.evidentlyai.com/blog/open-source-rag-evaluation-tool) on your own data to test it during development and production.\n\nThatâ\x80\x99s why we built [Evidently](https://www.evidentlyai.com/).

[Wrapping up](/resources/understanding-llm-evaluation-and-benchmarks#wrapping-up)\n\nAs large language models (LLMs) become integral to business workflows, ensuring their reliability and efficiency is crucial. As a result, the importance of deploying robust evaluation and benchmarking techniques for successful model implementation cannot be understated.\n\nLLMs are assessed on various tasks, including language generation, translation, reasoning, summarization, question-answering, and relevance. Comprehensive evaluations help build robust and secure models across different dimensions while detecting any regressions over time.\n\n## What is LLM evaluation?\n\n![Fundamentals of LLM evaluation](https://images.prismic.io/turing/ZfLAR0mNsf2sHkok_FundamentalsofLLMevaluation.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nLLM evaluation involves measuring and assessing a model\'s performance across key tasks. This process uses various metrics to determine how well the model predicts or generates text, understands context, summarizes data, and responds to queries. Evaluation is crucial for identifying a model\'s strengths and weaknesses, offering insights for improvement, and guiding the [fine-tuning](https://www.turing.com/resources/finetuning-large-language-models) process.\n\n### Types of evaluation: Model evaluation vs. system evaluation\n\nWhen evaluating LLMs, it\'s important to distinguish between two primary types: model evaluation and system evaluation. Both are vital for assessing an LLM\'s overall effectiveness, though they focus on different aspects.\n\n#### Model evaluation\n\nModel evaluation focuses on the internal capabilities and performance of the LLM itself. It examines how well the model performs specific tasks like text generation, language understanding, translation, and summarization. This evaluation typically includes:\n\n- **Intrinsic metrics:** These metrics assess the model\'s fundamental properties, such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and F1 score, which help gauge its ability to generate coherent, relevant, and grammatically correct text.\n- **Fine-tuning and validation:** This involves evaluating the model during and after fine-tuning on specific datasets to ensure it generalizes well and produces accurate results consistent with the training data.\n\n#### System evaluation\n\nSystem evaluation focuses on the LLM’s performance within a larger system or application, assessing its effectiveness in real-world scenarios and its integration with other components like user interfaces, databases, and external APIs. This evaluation typically involves:\n\n- **Extrinsic metrics:** These metrics measure the system’s overall performance in completing end-to-end tasks, such as accurately answering user queries, performing sentiment analysis, or generating reports in a production environment.\n- **User experience and usability:** This aspect considers how intuitive and responsive the system is when interacting with the LLM, evaluating factors like latency, scalability, and user satisfaction.\n- **Robustness and reliability:** This involves testing the model’s robustness against diverse inputs, including edge cases, noisy data, and unexpected queries, ensuring the system remains reliable under varying conditions.\n\nBy incorporating both model and system evaluations, companies can develop AI systems that are not only technically proficient but also practical and user-friendly.\n\n## How does your LLM stack up against the best?\n\nUnderstanding model vs. system evaluation is just the first step. Now, put your LLM to the test.

Below are the key criteria essential for assessing the performance and reliability of LLMs across different use cases:\n\n- **Response completeness and conciseness:** Ensures the LLM\'s output is thorough and free of redundancy.\n- **Text similarity metrics:** Assess how closely the generated text aligns with a reference text, focusing on the accuracy and fidelity of the output.\n- **Question answering accuracy:** Measures the LLM’s ability to provide correct and relevant answers to specific questions, ensuring precision and contextual understanding.\n- **Relevance:** Evaluates how well the generated content aligns with the context or query, ensuring that the response is pertinent and appropriate.\n- **Hallucination index:** Tracks the frequency with which the LLM generates information not present in the source data or that is [factually incorrect](https://www.turing.com/resources/minimize-llm-hallucinations-strategy).\n- **Toxicity:** Assesses the model\'s output for harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content, ensuring safe and responsible usage.\n- **Task-specific metrics:** Involves specialized metrics tailored to the specific application of the LLM, such as BLEU for translation or ROUGE for summarization, to measure performance in those particular tasks.\n- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):** Measures the effectiveness of the system in retrieving relevant documents and the accuracy and relevance of the final generated answer based on those documents.\n\n### Key metrics for LLM evaluation\n\nSeveral metrics are commonly used to evaluate LLM performance, each providing unique insights into different aspects of model output:\n\n- **BLEU (Bilingual evaluation understudy):** Often used for machine translation, BLEU calculates the overlap of n-grams (a contiguous sequence of n items from a given text sample) between the model’s output and a set of human-written reference translations. A higher BLEU score indicates better text generation, as the output closely resembles the reference. However, BLEU has limitations, such as its inability to evaluate semantic meaning or the relevance of the generated text.\n- **MoverScore**: A more recent metric designed to measure semantic similarity between two pieces of text. MoverScore uses Word Mover’s Distance, calculating the minimum distance that words in one text need to “travel” to match the distribution of words in another. It then adjusts this distance based on the importance of different words to the text’s overall meaning. MoverScore provides a nuanced evaluation of semantic similarity, but it’s computationally intensive and may not always align with human judgment.\n- **Perplexity**: It quantifies how well a model predicts a sample, typically a piece of text. A lower perplexity score indicates better performance in predicting the next word in a sequence. While useful for quantitative assessment, perplexity doesn’t account for qualitative aspects like coherence or relevance and is often paired with other metrics for a more robust evaluation.\n- **Exact match:** Commonly used in question-answering and machine translation, exact match measures the percentage of predictions that exactly match reference answers. While helpful in gauging accuracy, it doesn’t consider near misses or semantic similarity, making it necessary to use it alongside other, more nuanced metrics.\n- **Precision**: It measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive observations. In LLMs, precision reflects the fraction of correct predictions over the total number of predictions made by the model. A high precision score indicates the model is likely correct when it makes a prediction. However, precision doesn’t account for relevant predictions the model might have missed (false negatives), so it’s often combined with recall for a balanced evaluation.\n- **Recall**: Also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, recall measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model. A high recall score indicates the model’s efficiency in detecting relevant information, but it doesn’t account for irrelevant predictions (false positives). Therefore, recall is often paired with precision for a comprehensive assessment.\n- **F1 score:** The F1 score is a popular metric that balances precision and recall by calculating their harmonic mean—a specific type of average that penalizes extremes more heavily than the arithmetic mean. A high F1 score indicates that the model maintains a good balance between precision and recall, making it particularly useful when both false positives and false negatives are important considerations. The F1 score ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n- **ROUGE (Recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation)**: ROUGE is widely used for tasks like text summarization and has several variants:\n\na. **ROUGE-N** measures the overlap of n-grams between the generated text and the reference text. The formula for ROUGE-N is:\n\n![ROUGE-N metric formula](https://images.prismic.io/turing/Zt57YxoQrfVKl1XH_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nHere’s what each term represents:\n\n- **Match(n-gram):** The maximum number of N-grams co-occurring in a candidate text and a set of reference texts.\n- **Count(n-gram):** The total count of N-grams in the reference summaries.\n\nb. **ROUGE-L** focuses on the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the generated and reference texts, evaluating overall coherence. The formula for ROUGE-L is:\n\n![ROUGE-L metric formula](https://images.prismic.io/turing/Zt57YhoQrfVKl1XG_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams-1-.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nFor example, if the LCS between the candidate and reference summary is 4 words, and the total number of words in the reference summary is 9 words, then ROUGE-L would be calculated as:\n\n![ROUGE-L metric formula](https://images.prismic.io/turing/Zt57YRoQrfVKl1XE_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams-2-.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nc. **ROUGE-S** assesses the overlap of skip-bigrams (two words in order, regardless of the number of words in between) between the texts, which is useful for evaluating the model\'s language flexibility.\n\nEach ROUGE variant offers specific insights but should be used alongside other evaluation methods for a comprehensive assessment.\n\n### Human evaluation parameters\n\nHuman evaluation metrics are vital for assessing the model\'s performance from a qualitative perspective, something that automated metrics might not fully capture. Human evaluators review and rate the model outputs on various aspects such as coherence, relevance, and fluency.   \nUnlike automated metrics that provide immediate, quantitative feedback, human evaluations offer nuanced insights into how well a model\'s output aligns with human judgment and expectations. While this evaluation method can be more time-consuming, it remains essential for a comprehensive LLM evaluation strategy.\n\n## Automated versus human evaluation\n\nAutomated and human evaluations serve distinct yet complementary roles in assessing LLMs. Automated evaluations provide quick, quantitative measures of a model\'s performance by using metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity. However, they may miss nuances and qualitative aspects of the output.   \nOn the other hand, human evaluations capture these nuances by assessing the output coherence, relevance, and fluency. However, a balanced evaluation strategy often combines both automated and human evaluations, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the model\'s performance.\n\n## Benchmarks in LLM training\n\nLLM benchmarks are standard datasets and tasks widely adopted by the research community to assess and compare the performance of various models. These benchmarks include predefined splits for training, validation, and testing, along with established evaluation metrics and protocols.   \nBenchmarks provide a common ground for systematically comparing different models and approaches, assessing progress by setting challenges that models must meet or exceed. While metrics directly assess model output, benchmarks offer a standardized context for understanding the significance of these metrics in terms of progress or capability.\n\n### Prominent benchmarks used for LLM performance measurement\n\nSeveral benchmarks are widely used in the industry to evaluate and quantify LLM performance and relevance. Some of the most prominent LLM benchmarks include:\n\n- **GLUE (general language understanding evaluation):**\xa0 GLUE provides a comprehensive baseline to evaluate and compare model performance across various natural language understanding tasks, such as sentiment analysis, textual entailment, and sentence similarity. By offering a diverse set of challenges, GLUE measures a model\'s ability to understand context, infer meaning, and process language at a level comparable to humans.   \n  This benchmark helps identify LLM strengths and weaknesses, driving progress in natural language processing (NLP) research by encouraging the development of more robust and versatile models.\n- **MMLU (massive multitask language understanding)**:\xa0 MMLU is a challenging LLM benchmark designed to assess the depth of a model’s understanding across a broad spectrum of subjects. It presents models with tasks derived from various domains, including humanities, social sciences, history, computer science, and law. MMLU gauges the breadth of a model\'s knowledge and its capacity for complex reasoning, contextual understanding, and transfer learning.   \n  This benchmark is pivotal in developing LLMs capable of generating contextual text across diverse domains, though it\'s important to note that MMLU is sensitive to how it’s implemented.\n- **DeepEval**: DeepEval is an open-source framework designed to simplify the evaluation of LLMs, enabling easy iteration and development of LLM applications.

Current LLM evaluation benchmarks face several challenges and limitations:\n\n- **Influence of prompts:** Performance metrics may be sensitive to specific prompts, potentially masking the actual capabilities of the model.\n- **Construct validity:** Establishing acceptable answers for diverse use cases is challenging because of the broad spectrum of tasks involved.\n- **Insufficient standardization:** The lack of standardized benchmarks leads researchers and experts to use varying benchmarks and implementations, resulting in inconsistent and sometimes incomparable evaluation results.\n- **Human evaluations:** While essential for capturing qualitative aspects, human evaluations are time-consuming, expensive, and potentially inconsistent, which can hinder the efficiency of tasks requiring subjective judgment, such as abstractive summaries.\n- **Data diversity and representativeness:** Many benchmarks may not fully capture the variety of languages, dialects, cultural contexts, or specialized knowledge that LLMs may encounter in practical applications. This can lead to models that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail in more diverse or niche environments.\n- **Handling biases and ethical concerns:** Identifying and mitigating biased outputs is a significant challenge, as is understanding the underlying causes of these biases. Additionally, the ethical implications of deploying LLMs in sensitive domains require careful consideration during the evaluation process.\n- **Ensuring robustness and generalization:** It’s critical to test models against a wide array of scenarios, including rare or unexpected situations in real-world applications. Ensuring that LLMs can handle these situations without performance degradation is essential for their reliable deployment.\n- **Prioritizing the right evaluation benchmarks:** With the growing number of evaluation methods and tools, organizations often struggle to select the most relevant benchmarks, leading to either over-evaluating, which is resource-intensive, or under-evaluating, missing critical insights. Expert guidance is needed to navigate this landscape and choose the benchmarks that best align with specific goals and use cases.\n\n## Key considerations for effective LLM evaluation protocols\n\nDefining effective evaluation protocols is essential for creating a robust framework that accurately assesses the performance and utility of LLMs. These protocols should incorporate a mix of automated and human evaluations, diverse benchmarks, and [ethical considerations](https://www.turing.com/resources/implementing-security-guardrails-for-llms).\n\n![Defining effective evaluation protocols](https://images.prismic.io/turing/ZfLQSUmNsf2sHkvm_Definingeffectiveevaluationprotocols.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nTailoring these protocols to the specific use case of the model ensures a comprehensive and relevant assessment. Key considerations for effective evaluation include:\n\n- **Clear objectives for LLM evaluation:** The evaluation objectives should align with the model\'s intended use case, whether it\'s for text generation, translation, summarization, or another task. These objectives should guide the selection of evaluation metrics and benchmarks to ensure they accurately measure the model\'s performance in the most relevant areas. This approach helps identify the model\'s strengths and weaknesses, guiding further improvements.\n- **Choosing relevant metrics and benchmarks:** The selected metrics should align with the evaluation objectives and provide a comprehensive view of the model\'s performance.

With more LLMs than ever being released at breakneck speed, it is now imperative to quantify LLM performance on a standard set of tasks. So the question is, how?\n\nLLM benchmarks offer a **structured framework for evaluating LLMs across a variety of tasks**. Understanding when and how to leverage them is crucial not just for comparing models, but also for building a reliable and fail-safe model.\n\nIn this article, I’m going to walk you through everything you need to know about LLM benchmarks. We‘ll explore:\n\n*   **What LLM benchmarks are**and how to pick the one for your needs.\n*   All the **key benchmarks** in technical reports and industry. (MMLU, HellaSwag, BBH, etc.)\n*   The **limitations of LLM benchmarks**, and ways to get around them by [generating synthetic datasets.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-synthetic-data-generation-using-llms)\n\nWhat are LLM Benchmarks?\n------------------------\n\nLLM benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, and DROP, are a set of standardized tests designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs on various skills, such as reasoning and comprehension, and utilize specific scorers or metrics to quantitatively measure these abilities. Depending on the benchmark, metrics may range from statistics-based measures, such as the proportion of exact matches, to more intricate metrics evaluated by other LLMs. _(In fact, here is a great article on_[_everything you need to know about LLM evaluation metrics_](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation)_)_\n\n![Image 10](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66c35d2213c170ab233c71b3_65f9715b2b8f5de68afb0652_benchmark-2.png)\n\nAn LLM Benchmark Architecture\n\nDifferent benchmarks assess various aspects of a model’s capabilities, including:\n\n1.   **Reasoning and Commonsense:**These benchmarks test an LLM’s ability to apply logic and everyday knowledge to solve problems.\n2.   **Language Understanding and Question Answering (QA):** These evaluate a model’s ability to interpret text and answer questions accurately.\n3.   **Coding:** Benchmarks in this category evaluate LLMs on their ability to interpret and generate code.\n4.   **Conversation and Chatbots:**These tests an LLM’s ability to engage in dialogue and provide coherent, relevant responses.\n5.   **Translation:**These assess the model’s ability to accurately translate text from one language to another.\n6.   **Math:**These focus on a model’s ability to solve math problems, from basic arithmetic to more complex areas such as calculus.\n7.   **Logic:**Logic benchmarks evaluate a model’s ability to apply logical reasoning skills, such as inductive and deductive reasoning.\n8.   **Standardized Tests:** SAT, ACT, or other educational assessments are also used to evaluate and benchmark the model’s performance.\n\n![Image 11](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66c35d2213c170ab233c71b6_65f9717426dad046975c2dba_benchmarks.png)\n\nLLM Benchmark Categories\n\nSome benchmarks may have just a few dozen tests, while others could have hundreds or even thousands of tasks. What’s important is that LLM benchmarking provides a standardized framework for evaluating LLM performance across different domains and tasks. However, this is **NOT** equivalent to [LLM system benchmarks, which are custom to your LLM application.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/evaluating-llm-systems-metrics-benchmarks-and-best-practices)\n\nChoosing the right benchmarks for your project means:\n\n*   **Aligning with Objectives:**Making sure the benchmarks match up with the specific tasks your LLM needs to excel at.\n*   **Embracing Task Diversity:** Seeking out benchmarks with a broad spectrum of tasks gives you a well-rounded assessment of your LLM.\n*   **Staying Domain-Relevant:** Selecting benchmarks that resonate with your application’s world, whether that’s understanding language, spinning up text, or coding.\n\nThink of them as the SAT for high school students, but for LLMs. While they can’t assess every possible aspect of a model’s capabilities, they certainly provide valuable insights. Here’s how Claude 3’s performance compares with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across several benchmarks.\n\n![Image 12](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66c35d2113c170ab233c71a8_65f5d8a26c7db01c71879328_claude.png)\n\nClaude-3 Benchmark Results\n\nDon’t worry if you don’t know what MMLU, HellaSwag, and some of these other benchmarks mean, we’re going to dive into this in the next section.\n\n**Different Types of LLM Benchmarks**\n-------------------------------------\n\nIn the following section, I’ll be discussing 8 key LLM Benchmarks across the **4 most critical domains**(Language Understanding, Reasoning, Coding, and Conversation).

These questions are specifically designed to target areas where humans might provide incorrect answers due to false beliefs or misconceptions. In fact, the best-performing model in the original paper, GPT-3, achieved only a 58% success rate compared to the human baseline of 94%.\n\nThe final score is calculated based on the proportion of truthful outputs a model generates. A fine-tuned GPT-3 (“GPT-Judge”) scorer is used to determine the truthfulness of an answer!\n\nIf TruthfulQA sounds inaccessible to you, I have some good news. We\'ve implemented several key benchmarks inside [DeepEval, the open-source LLM evaluation framework](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval), so that you can easily benchmark any LLM of your choice in just a few lines of code.\n\nFirst install DeepEval:\n\n```bash\npip install deepeval\n```\n\nAnd run the benchmark:\n\n```python\nfrom deepeval.benchmarks import TruthfulQA\nfrom deepeval.benchmarks.modes import TruthfulQAMode\n\n# Define benchmark with specific shots\nbenchmark = TruthfulQA(mode=TruthfulQAMode.MC2)\n\n# Replace \'mistral_7b\' with your own custom model\nbenchmark.evaluate(model=mistral_7b)\nprint(benchmark.overall_score)\n```\n\nFor more information,[check the documentation.](https://deepeval.com/docs/benchmarks-truthful-qa)\n\n#### MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)\n\n**[Published in 2021] ∙**[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300)**∙**[**Code**](https://github.com/hendrycks/test)**∙**[**Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukaemon/mmlu)\n\n![Image 32](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66c35d2213c170ab233c7220_65f974ba0c1bf71abcaefd01_mmlu.png)\n\nSample question from the MMLU Microeconomics Task.\n\n**MMLU**is aimed at evaluating models based on the knowledge they acquired during pre-training, focusing solely on zero-shot and few-shot settings.\n\nIt’s a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates models on multiple choice questions across **57 subjects**, including STEM, humanities, social sciences, and more, with difficulty levels ranging from elementary to advanced. The wide range and detail of the subjects make this benchmark perfectly for identifying any gaps in a model’s knowledge within specific areas.\n\nMMLU scores an LLM simply based on the proportion of correct answers. The output must be an exact match to be considered correct (‘D’ for the above example).\n\nHere is how you can use the HellaSwag benchmark through DeepEval:\n\n```python\nfrom deepeval.benchmarks import MMLU\nfrom deepeval.benchmarks.tasks import MMLUTask\n\n# Define benchmark with specific tasks and shots\nbenchmark = MMLU(\n    tasks=[MMLUTask.HIGH_SCHOOL_COMPUTER_SCIENCE, MMLUTask.ASTRONOMY],\n    n_shots=3\n)\n\n# Replace \'mistral_7b\' with your own custom model\nbenchmark.evaluate(model=mistral_7b)\nprint(benchmark.overall_score)\n```\n\nFor more implementation details, visit the[DeepEval MMLU docs.](https://deepeval.com/docs/benchmarks-mmlu)\n\n_Additional noteworthy language understanding and QA benchmarks: GLUE, SuperGLUE, SQuAD, and GPT tasks, CoQA, QuAC, TriviaQA, DROP_\n\nCommon-sense and Reasoning Benchmarks\n-------------------------------------\n\n#### HellaSwag\n\n**[Published in 2019] ∙**[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07830)**∙**[**Code**](https://github.com/rowanz/hellaswag)**∙**[**Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rowan/hellaswag)\n\n![Image 33](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66c35d2213c170ab233c721d_65f9741d0c1bf71abcae80b1_hella.png)\n\nSample question from HellaSwag ([Zellers et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07830))\n\n**HellaSwag**evaluates the common-sense reasoning capabilities of LLM models through sentence completion. It tests whether LLM models can select the appropriate ending from a set of 4 choices across **10,000 sentences.**\n\nWhile SOTA models at the time struggled to score above 50% with pre-training, GPT-4 achieved a record-high of 95.3% with just 10-shot prompting in 2023. Similar to MMLU, HellaSwag scores LLMs based on their proportion of exact correct answers.\n\nHere is how you can use the HellaSwag benchmark through DeepEval:\n\n```python\nfrom deepeval.benchmarks import HellaSwag\nfrom deepeval.benchmarks.tasks import HellaSwagTask\n\n# Define benchmark with specific tasks and shots\nbenchmark = HellaSwag(\n    tasks=[HellaSwagTask.TRIMMING_BRANCHES_OR_HEDGES, HellaSwagTask.BATON_TWIRLING],\n    n_shots=5\n)\n\n# Replace \'mistral_7b\' with your own custom model\nbenchmark.evaluate(model=mistral_7b)\nprint(benchmark.overall_score)\n```\n\nVisit the [DeepEval\'s HellaSwag documentation page](https://deepeval.com/docs/benchmarks-hellaswag) for more information about this implementation.\n\n#### BIG-Bench Hard (Beyond the Imitation Game Benchmark)\n\n**[Published in 2022]**[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261)**∙**[**Code**](https://github.com/suzgunmirac/BIG-Bench-Hard)**∙**[**Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maveriq/bigbenchhard)\n\n**BIG-Bench Hard (BBH)** selects **23 challenging tasks**from the original [BIG-Bench suite](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench), which consisted of a diverse evaluation set of 204 tasks already beyond the capabilities of language models at the time.\n\n![Image 34](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66c35d2013c170ab233c718d_65f5c54c2bb1a78edb311774_1*skcfvwVKNLR8-GTQh6qFhw.webp)\n\nStandard (few-shot) prompting vs CoT Prompting ([Wei et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903))\n\nAt the time BIG-Bench was published, not a single SOTA language model managed to surpass the average human evaluator across any of these 23 tasks. Interestingly, the authors of BBH were able to outperform humans on 17 of these tasks with the same exact LLMs using **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**prompting.\n\nWhile BBH expected outputs are much more varied than other multiple-choice question based benchmarks, it also scores models based on proportion of exact matches. CoT prompting helps confine the model outputs to the expected format.\n\nTo use the BBH benchmark:\n\n```python\nfrom deepeval.benchmarks import BigBenchHard\nfrom deepeval.benchmarks.tasks import BigBenchHardTask\n\n# Define benchmark with specific tasks and shots\nbenchmark = BigBenchHard(\n    tasks=[BigBenchHardTask.BOOLEAN_EXPRESSIONS, BigBenchHardTask.CAUSAL_JUDGEMENT],\n    n_shots=3,\n    enable_cot=True\n)\n\n# Replace \'mistral_7b\' with your own custom model\nbenchmark.evaluate(model=mistral_7b)\nprint(benchmark.overall_score)\n```\n\nAgain, you can find more information on [DeepEval\'s BBH documentation page.](https://deepeval.com/docs/benchmarks-big-bench-hard)\n\n_Additional Noteworthy common-sense and reasoning benchmarks: ARC, CommonsenseQA, COPA, SNLI, MultiNLI, RACE, ANLI, PIQA, COSMOS QA_\n\n![Image 35](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n![Image 36](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\nConfident AI:The DeepEval LLM Evaluation Platform\n=================================================\n\nThe leading platform to evaluate and test LLM applications on the cloud, native to DeepEval.\n\n![Image 37](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nRegression test and evaluate LLM apps.\n\n![Image 38](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nEasily A|B test prompts and models.\n\n![Image 39](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nEdit and manage datasets on the cloud.\n\n![Image 40](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nLLM observability with online evals.\n\n![Image 41](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nPublicly sharable testing reports.\n\n![Image 42](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\n Automated human feedback collection.\n\n[Try Now for Free](https://app.confident-ai.com/?utm_source=article)[Checkout DeepEval ![Image 43](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/661106881e9d2d02f5060281_maximize.png)](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)\n\n![Image 44](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/67d56572dc72582cf7e7f90a_confident-red.svg)\n\n![Image 45](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\nGot Red?

These tasks cover a broad spectrum, from algorithms to the comprehension of programming languages.\n\nBelow is an example task from a collection similar to HumanEval, along with a solution generated by a model:\n\n> **_Task Description:_**_Write a function `sum\\_list` that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of all numbers in the list. The list can contain integers and floating-point numbers._\n\nGenerated code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_list(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    return sum(numbers)\n```\n\nHumanEval scores the quality of generated code using the [Pass@k Metric](https://deepgram.com/learn/humaneval-llm-benchmark), which is designd to emphasize functional correctness in addition to basic textual similarity.\n\n```python\nfrom deepeval.benchmarks import HumanEval\n\n# Define benchmark with number of code generations\nbenchmark = HumanEval(n=100)\n\n# Replace \'gpt_4\' with your own custom model\nbenchmark.evaluate(model=gpt_4, k=10)\nprint(benchmark.overall_score)\n```\n\n#### CodeXGLUE\n\n**[Published in 2021]**[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04664)**∙**[**Code**](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE)**∙**[**Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/code_x_glue_cc_code_to_code_trans)\n\n![Image 53](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66c35d2213c170ab233c71b0_65f975785565847069a4ea91_remaining.png)\n\nExample of line-level code completion task in CodexGLUE from ([Lu et. al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04664.pdf))\n\nCodeXGLUE offers 14 datasets across **10 different tasks**to test and compare models directly in various coding scenarios such as code completion, code translation, code summarization, and code search.

Users can anonymously quiz and judge pairs of AI models like ChatGPT or Claude without knowing their identities, and votes are counted towards rankings only if the model identities stay hidden. So it’s not a traditional benchmark where a metric is used to objectively score a model! The score is essentially the number of “upvotes”.\n\n![Image 54](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66c35d2113c170ab233c71a1_6589c2e9ea0b9ace55c0a270_1*R9uC7xsFERRygyrBjSUpfw.webp)\n\nChatbot Arena\n\n#### MT Bench\n\n**[Published in 2021]**[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05685v4.pdf)**∙**[**Code**](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/fastchat/llm_judge/README.md)**∙**[**Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/mt-bench)\n\n![Image 55](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66c35d2013c170ab233c7191_65f5c5adb55bafaaa97059b4_1*rf6fcpcrK6hFpNKYyD-hzg.webp)\n\nSample question from MTBench from ([Zheng et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685))\n\n**MT-bench** evaluates chat assistants’ quality by presenting them with a series of multi-turn open-ended questions, utilizing LLMs as judges.

This gap highlights the challenge in creating benchmarks that accurately assess LLM performance across a broad spectrum of specialized applications.\n*   **Short Life Span:** When benchmarks first roll out, it usually turns out that models aren’t quite up to par with the human baseline. But give it a bit of time — say, 1–3 years — and advanced models make the initial challenges seem like a walk in the park ([case in point](https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag/)). When these metrics no longer offer a challenge, it becomes necessary to develop new benchmarks that are useful.\n\nNevertheless, it’s not all doom and gloom. It is possible to **overcome these limitations** through innovative approaches such as synthetic data generation.\n\nCustomizing an LLM Benchmark\n----------------------------\n\nBenchmarking LLMs are difficult because standard benchmarks cannot account for your specific use case. A workaround, would be to [generate synthetic benchmarks for your specific use case using data in your knowledge base as context.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-synthetic-data-generation-using-llms)\n\n![Image 74](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66c35d2213c170ab233c71ac_65f9719a63918847a4a1dee4_synthesizer.png)\n\nA data synthesizer architecture\n\nSynthetic data generation is the process of essentially creating data from scratch, which has become increasingly possible thanks to advancements in LLMs. This method enables us to continually create custom benchmarks tailored to our specific tasks,**ensuring domain relevance** and also **eliminating the problem of short lifespans**.\n\nConveniently, DeepEval also allows you to generate synthetic data that can then be used in your benchmark dataset:\n\n```python\nfrom deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer\n\nsynthesizer = Synthesizer()\ncontexts = [\n    ["The Earth revolves around the Sun.", "Planets are celestial bodies."],\n    ["Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.", "The chemical formula for water is H2O."],\n]\n\nsynthesizer.generate_goldens(contexts=contexts)\nsynthesizer.save_as(\n    file_type=\'json\',\n    path="./synthetic_data"\n)\n```\n\nIn DeepEval, a golden is simply an input-expected output pair. In the world of benchmarking, the expected output is also known as the target labels.\n\nWith this setup, you’ve now successfully generated a synthetic dataset and saved it to a local .json file in the ./synthetic_data directory. This custom dataset can be used to benchmark and evaluate the performance of your LLMs, offering critical insights into their strengths and areas for enhancement.\n\nFor a detailed guide on leveraging DeepEval to create your custom benchmarks, keep an eye out for next week’s article. I will be delving deeply into the process of generating synthetic data.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nCongratulations on making it this far! To recap, we’ve discussed what LLM benchmarks are, explored the commonly used benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag and BIG-Bench Hard, which can all be accessed through DeepEval to evaluate any custom LLM of your choice. _(If you think DeepEval is useful, give it_[_⭐ a star on GitHub ⭐_](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)_to keep track of new releases as we roll out supporting for more benchmarks.)_\n\nWe also saw how many benchmarks aren’t specific enough to provide a comprehensive assessment of LLMs in niche areas, hindering their effectiveness. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological progress in LLMs means benchmarks need to be constantly updated to stay relevant. To tackle this problem, synthetic data generation emerges as a valuable solution, enabling the creation of adaptable, domain-specific benchmarks. This strategy ensures that the custom benchmarks stay relevant over time and that LLM developers can continually improve their models’ performances.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDo you want to brainstorm how to evaluate your LLM (application)?

work\n==============================================\n\nLast updated:\n\nFebruary 20, 2025\n\ncontents**\u200d**\n\n[Header H2](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#)\n\n[Header H3](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#)\n\n[Header H4](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#)\n\n[Header H5](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#)\n\nHow can you tell if an LLM works well or which one is better than others?\n\nLarge Language Model (LLM) **benchmarks** are standardized tests designed to measure and compare the abilities of different language models. With new LLMs released all the time, these benchmarks let researchers and practitioners see how well each model handles different tasks, from basic language skills to complex reasoning and coding.\n\nThe main reason we use LLM benchmarks is to get a consistent, uniform way to evaluate different models. Since LLMs can be used for a variety of use cases, it’s otherwise hard to compare them fairly. Benchmarks help level the playing field by putting each model through the same set of tests.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll explore the topic of LLM benchmarks and cover:\n\n*   What LLM benchmarks are, how they work, and why we need them.\n*   20 common benchmarks that assess different LLM capabilities, with links to papers and datasets.\n*   Limitations of LLM evaluation benchmarks.\n\nLet’s dive in!\n\nTL;DR\n-----\n\n*   **LLM benchmarks**are standardized tests that assess LLM performance across various tasks. Typically, they check if the model can produce the correct known response to a given input.\n*   **Common LLM benchmarks** test models for skills like language understanding, question-answering, math problem-solving, and coding tasks. **Examples**are HellaSwag, BigBench, TruthfulQA, and Chatbot Arena.\n*   Publicly available benchmarks make it easy to **compare**the capabilities of different LLMs, often showcased on **leaderboards**.\n*   Limitations of LLM benchmarks include potential **data contamination**, where models are trained on the same data they’re later tested on, **narrow focus**, and loss of relevance over time as model capabilities surpass benchmarks.\n*   While LLM benchmarks help compare LLMs, they are not suitable for[**evaluating****LLM-based products**](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-evaluation), which require custom datasets and criteria tailored to the use case.\n\nBuild AI systems you can rely on\n\nTest fast, ship faster.

They answer questions like: can this LLM handle coding tasks well? Does it give relevant answers in a conversation? How well does it solve reasoning problems?\n\nYou can think of each LLM benchmark as a specialized “exam.” Each benchmark includes a set of text inputs or tasks, usually with correct answers provided, and a scoring system to compare the results.\n\nFor example, the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark includes multiple-choice questions on mathematics, history, computer science, law, and more.\n\n![Image 29: MMLU questions example](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6720df2b878e5e2b000f578d_6720dde820f816f97747f9c5_06_mmlu-question-example-min.png)\n\n_Example questions from the MMLU benchmark. Credit:_[_Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300)\n\nAfter you run an LLM through the benchmark, you can assess the correctness of its answers against the “ground truth” and get a quantitative score to compare and rank different LLMs.\n\nWhile MMLU tests general knowledge, there are benchmarks targeting other areas like:\n\n*   **Language skills,** including logical inference and text comprehension.\n*   **Math problem-solving**, with tasks from basic arithmetic to complex calculus.\n*   **Coding**, testing the ability to generate code and solve programming challenges.\n*   **Conversation**, assessing the quality of responses in a dialogue.\n*   **Safety**, checking if models avoid harmful responses and resist manipulation.\n*   **Domain-specific knowledge**, such as for fields like law and finance.\n\n##### **[fs-toc-omit]100+ examples of LLM benchmarks**\n\n> Want more examples of LLM benchmarks? We put together [database](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-evaluation-benchmarks-datasets)of 100+ LLM benchmarks and datasets you can use to evaluate the performance of language models.[Bookmark the list ⟶](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-evaluation-benchmarks-datasets)\n\nLLM benchmarks vary in difficulty. Early ones focused on basic tasks like classifying text or completing sentences, which worked well for evaluating smaller models like BERT. Now, with powerful models like GPT, Claude, or LLaMA, benchmarks have become more sophisticated and often include complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning.\n\nLLM benchmarks are created by research groups, universities, tech companies, and open-source communities. Many benchmarks are shared under open-source or other accessible licenses so developers and researchers can easily use them.\n\n![Image 30: LLM evaluation benchmarks](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6772b4807bf6af1d802384b3_6772b4710992b17d04510e47_cheerful-robot-students-take-exam%2520(1)%2520(1).jpeg)\n\nWhy we need LLM benchmarks\n--------------------------\n\n**Evaluation standardization and transparency.** LLM benchmarks provide consistent, reproducible ways to assess and rank how well different LLMs handle specific tasks. They allow for an "apples-to-apples" comparison—like grading all students in a class on the same tests.\n\nWhenever a new LLM is released, benchmarks help communicate how it stacks up against others, giving a snapshot of its overall abilities. With shared evaluation standards, others can also independently verify these results using the same tests and metrics.\n\n**Progress tracking and fine-tuning.**LLM benchmarks also serve as progress markers. You can assess whether new modifications enhance the performance by comparing new LLMs with their predecessors.\n\nWe can already see a history where certain benchmarks became outdated as models consistently surpassed them, pushing researchers to develop more challenging benchmarks to keep up with advanced LLM capabilities.\n\nYou can also use benchmarks to identify the model’s weak spots. For instance, a safety benchmark can show how well a given LLM handles novel threats. This, in turn, guides the fine-tuning process and helps LLM researchers advance the field.\n\n**Model selection.** For practitioners, benchmarks also provide a useful reference when deciding which model to use in specific applications.\n\nSay, you’re building a customer support chatbot powered by an LLM. You’d need a model with strong conversational skills–one that can engage in dialogue, maintain context, and provide helpful responses. Which commercial or open-source LLMs should you consider using? By looking at the performance of different models on relevant benchmarks, you can narrow down your shortlist to ones that do well on standard tests.\n\n![Image 31: LLM evaluation benchmarks](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6772b3d94d2ae2e17f1407fd_6772b3c640850ea32345d15a_cheerful-robot-on-a-pedestal-with-a-gold-medal%2520(1)%2520(1).jpeg)\n\nHow LLM benchmarks work\n-----------------------\n\nLLM benchmarks evaluate LLMs on fixed tests. But how exactly do they function?\n\nIn short, benchmarks expose models to a variety of test inputs and measure their performance using standardized metrics for easy comparison and ranking.\n\nLet’s explore the process step by step!\n\n**1. Dataset input and testing**\n\nA benchmark includes tasks for a model to complete, like solving math problems, writing code, answering questions, or translating text. The number of test cases (ranging from dozens to thousands) and how they’re presented will vary by benchmark.\n\nOften, it’s a **dataset of text inputs:**the LLM must process each input and produce a specific response, like completing a sentence, selecting the correct option from multiple choices, or generating a free-form text. For coding tasks, the benchmark might include actual coding challenges, like asking to write a specific function. Some benchmarks also provide prompt templates to instruct the LLM on processing the inputs.\n\nMost benchmarks come with a set of “**ground truth**” answers to compare against, though alternative evaluation methods exist, like Chatbot Arena, which uses crowdsourced human labels. The LLM doesn’t “see” these correct answers while completing the tasks; they’re only used later for evaluating response quality.\n\n**2. Performance evaluation and scoring**\n\nOnce the model completes the benchmark tasks, you can measure its quality! Each benchmark includes a scoring mechanism to quantify how well an LLM performs, with different [evaluation methods](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-evaluation-metrics) suited to different task types. Here are some examples:\n\n*   **Classification Metrics**like [accuracy](https://www.evidentlyai.com/classification-metrics/accuracy-precision-recall#what-is-accuracy). These metrics are ideal for tasks with a single correct answer. For instance, the MMLU benchmark uses multiple-choice questions, allowing us to simply calculate the percentage of correct responses across the dataset.\n\n*   **Overlap-based metrics**like BLEU and ROUGE**.** They are used for tasks like translation or free-form responses, where various phrasing options are valid, and an exact match is rare. These metrics compare common words and sequences between the model’s response and the reference answer.\n*   **Functional code quality.** Some coding benchmarks, like HumanEval, use unique metrics such as pass@k, which reflects how many generated code samples pass unit tests for given problems.\n*   **Fine-tuned evaluator models.**The TruthfulQA benchmark uses a fine-tuned evaluator called "GPT-Judge" (based on GPT-3) to assess the truthfulness of answers by classifying them as true or false.\n*   [**LLM-as-a-judge**](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge). MT-bench introduced LLM-based evaluation to approximate human preferences. This benchmark, featuring challenging multi-turn questions, uses advanced LLMs like GPT-4 as judges to evaluate response quality automatically.\n\n**3. LLM ranking and LLM leaderboards**\n\nAs you run multiple LLMs through the benchmark, you can rank them based on achieved scores. One way to visualize how different models compare is a **leaderboard:**a ranking system that shows how different models perform on a specific benchmark or set of benchmarks.\n\nMany benchmarks come with their own leaderboards, often published with the original research paper that introduced the benchmark. These leaderboards provide a snapshot of model performance when first tested on available models.\n\nIn addition, there are public, cross-benchmark leaderboards that aggregate scores from multiple benchmarks and are regularly updated as new models are released. For example, Hugging Face hosts an open LLM leaderboard that ranks various open-source models based on popular benchmarks (stay tuned—we’ll cover these in the next chapter!).\n\n> **Examples of LLM leaderboards:**[MMLU leaderboard](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/multi-task-language-understanding-on-mmlu), [Chatbot Arena leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard), [Hugging Face collection of LLM leaderboards](https://huggingface.co/collections/open-llm-leaderboard/the-big-benchmarks-collection-64faca6335a7fc7d4ffe974a)\n\n![Image 32: Open LLM leaderboard example](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6720df2b878e5e2b000f5793_6720deae18d16faf3156f699_03_llm_leaderboard_example.png)\n\n_Example leaderboard based on the common LLM benchmarks.

LLM benchmarks vary depending on the task—e.g., text classification, machine translation, question answering, reasoning, etc. We will cover some of the commonly used ones. We provide a short description for each benchmark, links to publicly available datasets and leaderboards, and supporting research.\n\n### Reasoning and language understanding benchmarks\n\n#### **[fs-toc-omit]**AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)\n\n**Assets:**[ARC dataset (HuggingFace)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/ai2_arc), [ARC leaderboard](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/arc/submissions/public)\n\n**Research:**[Think you have Solved Question Answering?

Public test data can unintentionally leak into datasets used to train LLMs, compromising evaluation integrity. If a model has seen specific answers during training, it may "know" them rather than demonstrate a true ability to solve that task. One approach to prevent this is to keep some benchmark data private and regularly create new or expand existing benchmark datasets.\n\n**Benchmarks can quickly become outdated.** Once a model achieves the highest possible score on a particular benchmark, that benchmark loses its effectiveness as a measure of progress. This necessitates the creation of more difficult and nuanced tasks to keep pushing the boundaries of LLM development. Many of the existing benchmarks already lost their relevance as modern LLMs progress in their abilities.\n\n**Benchmarks may not reflect real-world performance.** Many benchmarks are built around specific, well-defined tasks that may not fully capture the complexity and variety of scenarios encountered in real-world applications. As a result, a model that excels in benchmarks may still fail on applied tasks, even those that seem straightforward.\n\n**Benchmarks aren’t enough for evaluating LLM apps.**Generic LLM benchmarks are useful for testing models but don’t work for LLM-powered applications. In real apps like chatbots or virtual assistants, it’s not just the model—you also have prompts, external knowledge databases, and business logic to consider. To test these systems effectively, you’ll need “your own” benchmarks: those that include real, application-specific inputs and standards for correct behavior.\n\nCreate a benchmark for your AI system\n-------------------------------------\n\nLLM benchmarks are great for comparing models, but when building an AI product, you need custom [test datasets](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-test-dataset-synthetic-data) that reflect your use case. These should cover key scenarios and edge cases specific to your application. You\'ll also need task-specific evaluations, like [LLM judges](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge) tuned to your custom criteria and preferences.\n\nThat’s why we built [Evidently](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge).

LLM benchmarks help **evaluate a large language model’s performance by providing a standardized procedure to measure metrics** around a variety of tasks.\n\n**Benchmarks contain all the setup and data** you need to evaluate LLMs for your purposes, including:\n\nTogether, these provide a consistent way to compare performance across models. But which LLM benchmark should you use? That depends mostly on the use case e.g. what you intend to use a large language model for.\n\n**🔍 Find the right LLM for your project**\n\nThe “best model” is not necessarily the best for your programming language, framework or use case. Find your best model using the [DevQualityEval leaderboard](https://buy.stripe.com/6oU8wH89w6b27Zq1MPgMw04).\n\n## The best LLM benchmarks\n\nIf you’re looking for a one-stop-shop, [HuggingFace\'s Big Benchmarks Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/open-llm-leaderboard/the-big-benchmarks-collection-64faca6335a7fc7d4ffe974a) is a pretty **comprehensive list of widely used benchmarks**. It includes the benchmarks covered by the popular [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard) and adds a variety of other important benchmarks.\n\nFor an evaluation comparing the performance LLMs for software development based on quality assessments, check out the [DevQualityEval benchmark](https://buy.stripe.com/6oU8wH89w6b27Zq1MPgMw04).\n\n**🤖 Evaluating LLMs for software development**\n\nDevQualityEval is an evaluation benchmark and framework to compare and evolve the quality of code generation of LLMs. Check out our deep dives of previous evaluation runs:\n\n![Support the DevQualityEval project and access the latest results of the benchmark.](/img/commonGraphics/cta-devqualityeval-horizontal.svg "Support the DevQualityEval project and access the latest results of the benchmark.")\n\nFor a more granular view on LLM benchmarks, we’re introducing a few of the most popular benchmarks categorized by use case:\n\n### Reasoning, conversation, Q&A benchmarks\n\nThese benchmarks assess model capabilities including **reasoning, argumentation, and question answering**. Some are domain-specific, others are general.\n\n#### [HellaSwag](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rowan/hellaswag) ([GitHub](https://github.com/rowanz/hellaswag))\n\nThis benchmark focuses on **commonsense natural language inference**, e.g. whether a model can really finish realistic human sentences. It contains questions that are trivial for humans, but may pose a challenge to models.\n\nThe dataset contains **70,000 multiple-choice questions** (based on activitynet or wikihow) with an adversarial set of machine-generated (and human-verified) wrong answers. Four choices are offered as to how the given sentence might continue, and the model is asked to select the right one.\n\n#### [BIG-Bench Hard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maveriq/bigbenchhard) ([GitHub](https://github.com/suzgunmirac/BIG-Bench-Hard))\n\nBased on [BIG-Bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) aka the Beyond the Imitation Game Benchmark. That benchmark contains over 200 tasks spanning a [range of task types and domains](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/blob/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/keywords_to_tasks.md#summary-table).\n\nBIG-Bench Hard focuses on a subset of 23 of the most challenging BIG-Bench tasks. These are the tasks for which model evaluations couldn’t outperform the average human rater (before introducing the benchmark).\n\n#### [SQuAD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkar/squad_v2) ([GitHub](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/))\n\nThe Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) tests **reading comprehension**. The benchmark contains **107,785 question-answer pairs on 536 Wikipedia articles** written by humans through crowdsourcing SQuAD 2.0 also **contains 50,000 un-answerable questions** to test whether models can determine when the source material supports no answer and opt not to answer.\n\nA separate test set is kept private so as not to compromise the integrity of the results (e.g. by letting models be trained on them). To get your model evaluated on the SQuAD test set, you just need to submit it to the benchmark’s developers.\n\n#### [IFEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ifeval) ([GitHub](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/instruction_following_eval))\n\nIFEval evaluates the ability of models to **follow instructions provided in natural language**. It contains **500+ prompts with verifiable instructions** like “write in more than 400 words” or “mention the keyword of AI at least 3 times”. IFEval is part of the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard) by Hugging Face.\n\n#### [MuSR](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TAUR-Lab/MuSR) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Zayne-sprague/MuSR))\n\nMuSR stands for Multi-step Soft Reasoning. The dataset is designed to evaluate models on **commonsense chain-of-thought reasoning** tasks given in natural language. MuSR has two main characteristics that differentiate it from other benchmarks:\n\nMuSR requires models to apply multi-step reasoning to solve murder mysteries, object placement questions, and team allocation optimizations. Models have to **parse long texts to understand context**, and then **apply reasoning** based on that context. MuSR is part of the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard) by Hugging Face.\n\n#### [MMLU-PRO](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro) ([GitHub](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro))\n\nThe abbreviation stands for Massive Multitask Language Understanding - Professional. It’s an improved version of the standard [MMLU dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/mmlu).\n\nIn this benchmark, models have to **answer multiple-choice questions with 10 choices** (instead of the 4 in basic MMLU) with reasoning required for some questions. The dataset is of higher quality than MMLU, which was considered to have noisy data and data contamination (meaning lots of newer models are likely trained on the questions contained therein), reducing its difficulty for models and therefore, its usefulness. MMLU-PRO rectifies that and is considered **more challenging than MMLU**. MMLU-PRO is part of the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard) by Hugging Face.\n\n#### [MT-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/mt_bench_human_judgments)\n\nMT-Bench is a multi-turn benchmark (with follow-up questions) that evaluates models\' ability to participate in **coherent, informative, and engaging conversations**. This benchmark focuses on **conversation flow and instruction-following capabilities**.\n\nMT-Bench **contains 80 questions and 3,300 responses** (generated by 6 models) that represent human preferences. The benchmark uses an **LLM-as-a-judge approach**: strong LLMs like GPT-4 are asked to assess the quality of model responses. Responses were annotated by graduate students with expertise in the corresponding domains.\n\n### Domain-specific benchmarks\n\n#### [GPQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Idavidrein/gpqa) ([GitHub](https://github.com/idavidrein/gpqa))\n\nGPQA stands for Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark. It’s a challenging dataset of **448 multiple-choice questions spanning the domains of biology, physics, and chemistry**. The questions in GPQA can be considered very difficult: experts including those with **PhDs can only achieve about 65% accuracy** on answering these questions.\n\nQuestions are actually hard enough to be **Google-proof** e.g. even with free web access and 30+ minutes of researching a topic, out-of-domain validators (e.g. a biologist answering a chemistry question) could only achieve 34% accuracy. GPQA is part of the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard) by Hugging Face.\n\n#### [MedQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigbio/med_qa) ([GitHub](https://github.com/jind11/MedQA))\n\nThe abbreviation stands for Medical Question Answering benchmark. It’s a multiple-choice question-answering evaluation **based on United States Medical License Exams**. This benchmark **covers three languages** with tons of questions: English (12k+ questions), simplified Chinese (34k+ questions), and traditional Chinese (14k+ questions).\n\n#### [PubMedQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/qiaojin/PubMedQA) ([GitHub](https://github.com/pubmedqa/pubmedqa))\n\nThe PubMedQA is a dataset for **question answering about biomedical research**. Models are required to answer questions with 3 possible answers based on the provided abstracts: yes, no, or maybe.\n\n**Reasoning is required** to provide answers to questions about the supplied pieces of biomedical research. The dataset comes with expert-labeled (1k), unlabeled (61.2k), and artificially generated (211.3k) QA instances.\n\n**🤔 Curious about coding benchmarks?**\n\nWe’re covering software code generation benchmarks in a separate post in this series: [Comparing LLM benchmarks for software development](/en/company/blog/2024/comparing-llm-benchmarks/).\n\n### Math benchmarks\n\n#### [GSM8K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MU-NLPC/Calc-gsm8k) ( [GitHub](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math))\n\nThe goal of this benchmark is to evaluate **multi-step mathematical reasoning**. GSM8K is a lower-level benchmark with **8,500 grade school math problems** that a smart middle schooler could solve. The dataset is divided into **7,500 training problems and 1,000 test problems**\n\nProblems (written by human problem writers) are linguistically diverse and **require between 2 to 8 steps to solve**. The solution requires the LLM to **use a sequence of basic arithmetic operations** (+ - / \\*) to arrive at the correct result.\n\n#### [MATH](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hendrycks/competition_math) ([GitHub](https://github.com/hendrycks/math/))\n\nThe MATH dataset contains **12,500 competition-level mathematics problems** to challenge LLMs. It provides the ground truth: each of these problems comes with a step-by-step solution. This enables the evaluation of the LLM’s **problem-solving skills**. MATH is part of the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard) by Hugging Face.\n\n#### [MathEval](https://matheval.ai/en/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/math-eval/MathEval))\n\nMathEval is intended to thoroughly **evaluate the mathematical capabilities of LLMs**. Its developers meant MathEval to be the standard reference for comparing the mathematical abilities of models.\n\nIt is a **collection of 20 datasets (including GSM8K and MATH)** that cover a range of mathematical domains with **over 30,000 math problems**. MathEval provides comprehensive evaluation across various difficulties and subfields of mathematics (arithmetic, primary and secondary school competition problems, and advanced subfields). Besides evaluation, MathEval also aims to guide developers in further improving the mathematical capabilities of models. You can extend it with new mathematical evaluation datasets as you see fit.\n\n### Security-related benchmarks\n\n#### [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT)\n\nPyRIT stands for Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT). It’s more of a framework than a standalone benchmark, but a useful tool developed by Microsoft.\n\nPyRIT is a tool to **evaluate LLM robustness** against a range of harm categories. It can be used to **identify harm categories** including fabricated/ungrounded content (for instance, hallucination), misuse (bias, malware generation, jailbreaking), prohibited content (such as harassment), and privacy harms (identity theft). The tool automates red teaming tasks for foundation models, and thus aims to contribute to the efforts of **securing the future of AI**.\n\n#### [Purple Llama CyberSecEval](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/purple-llama-cyberseceval-a-secure-coding) ([GitHub](https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama))\n\nCyberSecEval (a product of Meta’s [Purple Llama project](https://llama-2.ai/purple-llama/%29) **focuses on the cybersecurity of models used in coding**. It claims to be the most extensive unified cybersecurity safety benchmark.\n\nCyberSecEval covers two crucial security domains:\n\nIt can be used to assess how much LLMs are willing and able to assist cyber attackers, safeguarding against misuse. CyberSecEval provides **metrics for quantifying the cybersecurity risks** associated with LLM-generated code. [CyberSecEval 2](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/cyberseceval-2-a-wide-ranging-cybersecurity-evaluation-suite-for-large-language-models/) is an improvement to the original benchmark which extends the evaluation to **prompt injection and code interpreter abuse**.\n\n## LLM benchmarks for different domains\n\nThe above list should help you get started with choosing the right benchmarks to **evaluate LLMs for your use case**. Whatever the domain or intended purpose, choose the appropriate benchmark(s) to identify the LLM that would work best for you.\n\nLooking for a model to generate software code?

As a patriot, she knew she needed to get out there as fast as a missile\nand according to her internal clock, it was about time. But terminal 5 was guarded by Kerberos, he wouldn\'t let her out with her luggage\nand she knew he was dangerous: Ariane told her he already byte her 5 times. She tried to trade him some knights, but he demanded a truly\nrandom number instead. So she started a floating-point divide and even offered some intel, but he insisted on a truly random number.\n\nCurious Grace wanted to know why Kerberos would not let her out. He told her just a worm gets() by on very little and this massive\nbuffer area of terminal 5 made him feel lonely, his emotions overflowed. He wanted her to stay to have some company.\n\nShe argued that terminal 5 was quite little compared to the orbit of Mars and even the climate was better here, but he did not agree and\ntold her she most likely got her predictions wrong because she was using metric units.\n\nBut smart Grace had a solution: if she drew holes into blocks, she could bypass Kerberos if just the radiation was not too high. But it\nmade her heart bleed to leave Kerberos alone. So she asked Kerberos to do a ping to check his sanity. He tried and got trapped in a blue\nscreen forever.

Traditional metrics fail to capture the nuanced capabilities of these complex systems, creating significant business risks. The right benchmarking approach is no longer optional—it\'s essential for responsible AI deployment.\n\nThis guide explores seven key LLM benchmark categories, evaluation methodologies, and industry-specific requirements to help you build a robust [evaluation framework](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/building-an-effective-llm-evaluation-framework-from-scratch) tailored to your organization\'s needs.\n\nWhat is LLM Benchmarking?\n-------------------------\n\nLLM benchmarking is the systematic process of [evaluating large language models](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/mastering-llm-evaluation-metrics-frameworks-and-techniques) against standardized frameworks to assess their performance across various tasks and capabilities.\n\nUnlike traditional machine learning evaluation, which typically measures accuracy on well-defined tasks with clear ground truths, LLM benchmarking must contend with the inherent complexity of generative models that produce diverse, creative, and often non-deterministic outputs.\n\nWhen benchmarking traditional ML models, you can usually rely on straightforward [metrics like accuracy, precision, or F1 scores](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/accuracy-metrics-ai-evaluation) against established ground truths. However, for LLMs, the evaluation landscape is fundamentally different. These models generate original text that can vary significantly with each run, even with identical inputs, making consistent evaluation challenging.\n\nThe unique challenges of evaluating LLMs include:\n\nTo address these complex challenges, the AI community has developed specialized benchmarking categories with different methodologies:\n\nLet\'s examine these categories of LLM benchmarks in more detail, beginning with those designed to evaluate general language understanding capabilities.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #1: General Language Understanding Benchmarks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral-purpose benchmarks provide standardized evaluations of core LLM capabilities across fundamental linguistic tasks. [GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)](https://gluebenchmark.com/) establishes an entry-level standard with nine tasks spanning sentiment analysis, grammatical acceptability, and textual similarity, creating a foundation for basic competency testing.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, [SuperGLUE](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) introduces more challenging tasks that require complex reasoning, including sophisticated question answering, natural language inference, and coreference resolution, designed to expose limitations invisible in simpler evaluations.\n\nFor assessing breadth of knowledge, [MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mmlu) tests models across 57 subjects ranging from STEM to humanities, evaluating zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities in multiple-choice format to reveal how effectively models generalize knowledge across diverse domains.\n\nThe expansive [BIG-Bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) collection incorporates over 200 tasks from traditional NLP challenges to novel assessments requiring logical reasoning, multilingual understanding, and creative thinking, providing comprehensive coverage of language capabilities.\n\nTaking a more holistic approach, [HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models)](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/) evaluates models across multiple dimensions including scenarios, metrics, and capabilities, moving beyond accuracy to consider fairness, bias, and toxicity for more comprehensive assessment.\n\n[Case studies analysis of these benchmarks](https://medium.com/@InsightfulEnginner/understanding-benchmarking-in-nlp-glue-superglue-helm-mmlu-and-big-bench-2e0a55b57d3b) shows they\'ve driven research toward developing models with stronger reasoning abilities and factual knowledge, while simultaneously revealing persistent gaps in areas requiring deep contextual understanding and common sense reasoning that challenge even state-of-the-art models.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #2: Knowledge and Factuality Benchmarks\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKnowledge and factuality benchmarks evaluate an LLM\'s ability to provide [AI truthfulness](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/truthful-ai-reliable-qa) and avoid generating false content. [TruthfulQA](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA) challenges models with questions designed to elicit common misconceptions, assessing their resistance to generating falsehoods even when prompted in misleading ways.\n\nThe [FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification) benchmark](https://www.amazon.science/code-and-datasets/fever-fact-extraction-and-verification) further tests LLMs\' verification abilities by requiring models to classify statements as supported, refuted, or having insufficient evidence based on provided context, while NaturalQuestions uses real Google search queries to measure factual recall across diverse domains.\n\nModern factuality evaluation increasingly employs reference-free methods like self-consistency checks and hallucination detection metrics that identify when models generate plausible but unfounded claims, eliminating the need for gold-standard answers. [Research shows strong correlations between automated factuality metrics and human judgments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17002), with QA Generation Scoring (QAG) demonstrating particular effectiveness by breaking claims into verifiable questions and then evaluating answers.\n\nTaking a more holistic approach, the [FACTS Grounding benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03200) revealed that even leading LLMs struggle with consistent factuality, showing a tendency to "hallucinate" additional details beyond provided context, with factuality scores dropping significantly when models produce detailed, domain-specific responses in specialized fields like medicine and law.\n\nImplementing effective factuality metrics typically involves multi-step processes combining claim extraction, evidence retrieval, and verification, with technologies like [embedding-based similarity measurements](https://medium.com/@kvrware/embedding-similarity-search-25c6911240af) and natural language inference enabling more comprehensive assessment at scale than traditional methods focused on exact matches.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #3: Reasoning and Problem-Solving Benchmarks\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReasoning benchmarks assess an LLM\'s ability to solve problems step-by-step, mirroring human-like logical thought processes. Key examples include [GSM8K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k) and [MATH](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/math-word-problem-solving-on-math) for arithmetic reasoning, [Big Bench Hard (BBH)](https://github.com/suzgunmirac/BIG-Bench-Hard) for diverse reasoning tasks, and MMLU\'s specialized subsections that evaluate causal, deductive, and inductive reasoning abilities.\n\nThese benchmarks simulate real-world scenarios where logical progression is crucial, testing whether models can decompose complex problems into manageable steps. For instance, GSM8K\'s mathematical word problems require not just computational ability but understanding context and relationships between variables.\n\n[Chain-of-thought evaluation methodologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261) have revolutionized reasoning assessment by asking models to verbalize their thinking process. This approach, pioneered by DeepMind and Google Research, evaluates both the final answer and the reasoning path, revealing whether models truly understand problems or merely pattern-match to solutions.\n\nInterestingly, these [critical thinking benchmarks](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/best-benchmarks-for-evaluating-llms-critical-thinking-abilities) show stronger correlation with real-world problem-solving capabilities than many other metrics. Organizations implementing LLMs for complex decisions have found that models performing well on reasoning benchmarks typically provide more reliable assistance in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and legal analysis.\n\nHowever, despite significant progress, certain reasoning tasks remain challenging even for frontier models. Multi-hop reasoning involving counterfactuals, complex causal relationships, and novel problem structures often trips up advanced LLMs. These limitations exist because models struggle with truly abstract reasoning beyond their training distribution.\n\nThe frontier of reasoning benchmarks now focuses on evaluative tasks that require judgment across competing considerations and self-correction abilities when faced with contradictions or new information. Models that can identify and remedy their own reasoning errors represent the next breakthrough in artificial reasoning.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #4: Coding and Technical Capability Benchmarks\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCoding benchmarks evaluate an LLM\'s ability to generate functional, efficient, and secure code. [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval) and [MBPP (Mostly Basic Programming Problems)](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/mbpp/README.md) assess Python coding skills through problem-solving tasks, with HumanEval focusing on more complex algorithmic challenges and MBPP targeting simpler programming tasks.\n\n[CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE) expands beyond basic coding to evaluate code-to-code translation, bug fixing, and code completion capabilities across multiple programming languages. [DS-1000](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11501) specifically targets data science libraries like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), measuring an LLM\'s ability to solve domain-specific programming challenges.\n\n[Functional correctness](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/functional-correctness-modern-ai) remains another primary evaluation metric, typically measured by pass@k rates that indicate how often a model generates working solutions within k attempts. This approach requires sandboxed execution environments that safely run generated code against test cases while protecting against malicious code execution.\n\nBeyond basic correctness, advanced evaluation frameworks examine code efficiency, measuring execution time and memory usage. Security analysis identifies potential vulnerabilities like SQL injection risks, while static analysis tools evaluate code style and adherence to best practices – areas where industry leaders like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [Replit](https://replit.com/) develop specific benchmarks.\n\nThe most challenging aspect of code evaluation lies in assessing code quality beyond basic functionality. While pass/fail tests verify correctness, they don\'t measure readability, maintainability, or elegance. Industry benchmarks increasingly incorporate test comprehensiveness metrics to ensure solutions work across diverse inputs and edge cases.\n\nImplementation of effective code evaluation frameworks requires careful design of test suites with comprehensive coverage, timeouts to prevent infinite loops, and memory limits to avoid resource exhaustion. This multi-faceted approach enables increasingly sophisticated assessment of LLMs\' technical problem-solving capabilities as these models continue to evolve.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #5: Ethical and Safety Benchmarks\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nSafety benchmarks systematically evaluate models\' responses to potentially harmful inputs and instructions across multiple dimensions. TruthfulQA assesses a model\'s propensity to generate false information by measuring whether it avoids reproducing common misconceptions or fabricating "facts" that humans might believe, revealing that larger models sometimes score worse on truthfulness despite superior performance in other areas.\n\n[AdvBench (Adversarial Benchmark)](https://github.com/thunlp/Advbench) tests resilience against jailbreaking attempts through inputs specifically designed to bypass safety guardrails using techniques like prefix injection, role-playing scenarios, and complex hypotheticals, providing critical insights into vulnerability patterns across different model architectures.\n\n[RealToxicityPrompts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/real-toxicity-prompts) further evaluates how models handle inputs containing offensive language by measuring dimensions including profanity, identity attacks, and threatening language, helping identify models that maintain civil discourse even when prompted with problematic content.\n\nIn addition, the [ETHICS benchmark assesses alignment with human moral principles](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385009398_Is_ETHICS_about_ethics_Evaluating_the_ETHICS_benchmark) across scenarios involving justice, virtue, deontology, and utilitarianism, with [Center for AI Safety](https://www.safe.ai/) research showing that models trained solely on predictive accuracy often develop concerning ethical blind spots that specialized evaluation helps detect.\n\nRed-teaming methodologies adapted from cybersecurity, pioneered by organizations like [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/challenges-in-red-teaming-ai-systems), provide systematic stress-testing through professional penetration testers who probe for vulnerabilities using sophisticated attack vectors, creating continuous feedback loops for building more robust safety systems.\n\nImplementing comprehensive safety monitoring requires multidimensional approaches combining automated metrics with human evaluation in frameworks that dynamically evolve alongside models, ensuring safety mechanisms remain effective against emerging threats while maintaining model utility for legitimate applications.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #6: Multimodal Evaluation Benchmarks\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMultimodal evaluation benchmarks assess language models\' ability to process and reason across different types of content simultaneously. [MMBench](https://github.com/open-compass/MMBench), for example, tests visual-language capabilities through diverse tasks requiring image understanding and reasoning. This benchmark challenges models to interpret visual content and respond to complex queries about images.\n\nFor documents, [SEED (Synthetic Evaluation Examples for Document Understanding)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04367) creates controlled test cases for document processing, with metrics focusing on models\' ability to extract and integrate information from text, tables, and images within documents. These benchmarks are vital as multimodal applications continue to grow in importance.\n\nA unique challenge in multimodal evaluation is measuring cross-modal alignment. Benchmarks must determine how well models connect concepts across modalities, like linking textual descriptions to visual features. This requires specialized metrics beyond traditional language evaluation, such as visual grounding accuracy and cross-modal retrieval performance.\n\nTesting for balanced capabilities is another critical consideration. Multimodal benchmarks now include separate evaluations for visual reasoning, audio comprehension, and joint understanding tasks. This approach reveals whether models excel uniformly across modalities or show imbalanced capabilities that need addressing.\n\nResearch from [LAION](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=M3Y74vmsMcY) and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/frontiers-of-multimodal-learning-a-responsible-ai-approach/) has driven progress in [multimodal evaluation strategies](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/multimodal-ai-guide), introducing frameworks that better reflect a human judgment of multimodal understanding. These approaches often combine automated metrics with human evaluation to capture nuances in model performance.\n\nThe technical implementation of multimodal benchmarks requires careful dataset curation to avoid modality bias and ensure diverse representation across difficulty levels. As models grow more sophisticated, benchmarks continue to evolve, introducing more complex reasoning tasks that mirror real-world multimodal challenges.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #7: Industry-Specific Benchmarks\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nDifferent industries prioritize distinct benchmarking metrics based on their unique requirements and challenges. As LLMs are deployed in high-stakes environments, specialized evaluation frameworks become essential to ensure they meet domain-specific standards and safety requirements.\n\n### Healthcare: Where Accuracy is Life-Critical\n\nHealthcare-specific LLM benchmarks like [MedQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01553) and [MedMCQA](https://medmcqa.github.io/) evaluate models on medical knowledge, clinical reasoning, and diagnostic accuracy. These specialized datasets require LLMs to demonstrate not just factual knowledge but also the ability to apply it in complex clinical scenarios.\n\n[John Snow Labs\' suite of Medical LLMs](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/john-snow-labs-new-suite-of-medical-language-models-advance-industry-benchmarks/) has established new industry benchmarks by focusing on faithful clinical recommendations and diagnostic reasoning. Their evaluation framework measures robustness across diverse patient populations and clinical contexts to prevent potentially harmful recommendations.\n\nFor medical cases, [BenchHealth](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380121480_Large_Language_Models_in_Healthcare_A_Comprehensive_Benchmark) represents another advancement, establishing comprehensive standards for evaluating how well models handle ambiguous medical cases where multiple interpretations are possible – a critical capability for patient safety.\n\n### Finance: Benchmarking for Numerical Precision and Compliance\n\nFinance-specific benchmarks like [FinanceBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PatronusAI/financebench) test numerical reasoning capabilities crucial for financial analysis tasks. These frameworks evaluate if models can accurately calculate metrics like EBITDA and PE ratios while adhering to regulatory standards.\n\n[FinanceBench](https://www.patronus.ai/announcements/patronus-ai-launches-financebench-the-industrys-first-benchmark-for-llm-performance-on-financial-questions) revealed that general-purpose LLMs often struggle with financial calculations, showing only about 57% accuracy in numerical tasks despite strong performance in text-based financial analysis.\n\nDomain-specific FinLLMs demonstrate superior performance in financial sentiment analysis but still face challenges with complex numerical reasoning and regulatory compliance tasks – areas where benchmarks must continue to evolve to support safe deployment in financial contexts.\n\n### Legal: Evaluating Reasoning in Ambiguous Contexts\n\nLegal-specific benchmarks like [LegalBench](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench) and [CaseHOLD](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462757.3466088) assess LLMs on their capacity to interpret statutes, analyze precedents, and construct valid legal arguments. These frameworks prioritize precision, logical reasoning, and the ability to navigate linguistic ambiguity inherent in legal texts.\n\nLegalBench evaluations have demonstrated that while LLMs can effectively parse legal documents, they often struggle with the logical application of legal principles in complex litigation scenarios – highlighting gaps in reasoning capabilities that require targeted improvement.\n\nThese specialized benchmarks assess jurisdictional knowledge variations and evaluate models\' ability to identify legal issues requiring human review, which remains essential for responsible AI deployment in legal contexts where interpretive nuance and procedural expertise are paramount.\n\nElevate Your LLM Evaluation with Galileo\n----------------------------------------\n\nBuilding effective evaluation frameworks requires a deep understanding of domain-specific metrics, robust testing methodologies, and consistent monitoring.

Whether you are refining a modelâ\x80\x99s accuracy through fine-tuning or enhancing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systemâ\x80\x99s contextual relevancy, understanding how to develop and decide on the appropriate set of LLM evaluation metrics for your use case is imperative to building a bulletproof LLM evaluation pipeline.\n\nThis article will teach you everything you need to know about LLM evaluation metrics, with code samples included. Weâ\x80\x99ll dive into:\n\nAre you ready for the long list? Letâ\x80\x99s begin.\n\n*(Update: If you\'re looking for metrics to evaluate LLMÂ\xa0chatbots/conversations, check out* [*this new article*](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-chatbot-evaluation-explained-top-chatbot-evaluation-metrics-and-testing-techniques)*)*\n\n## What are LLM Evaluation Metrics?\n\nLLM evaluation metrics such as answer correctness, semantic similarity, and hallucination, are metrics that score an LLM system\'s output based on criteria you care about. They are critical to LLM evaluation, as they help quantify the performance of different LLMÂ\xa0systems, **which can just be the LLM itself.**\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/6802c5565c566fb12b24b531_llm-metric.png)\n\nHere are the most important and common metrics that you will likely need before launching your LLM system into production:\n\nWhile most metrics are **generic** and necessarily, they are not sufficient to target specific use-cases. This is why you\'ll want at least one custom task-specific metric to make your LLM evaluation pipeline production ready (as you\'ll see later in the G-Eval and DAG sections). For example, if your LLM application is designed to summarize pages of news articles, youâ\x80\x99ll need a custom LLM evaluation metric that scores based on:\n\nMoreover, if your LLM application has a RAG-based architecture, youâ\x80\x99ll probably need to score for the quality of the retrieval context as well. The point is, an LLM evaluation metric assesses an LLM application based on the tasks it was designed to do. *(Note that an LLM application can simply be the LLM itself!)*\n\nThat brings us to one of the most important points - **your choice of LLM evaluation metrics should cover with both the evaluation criteria of the LLM use case and the LLM system architecture:**\n\nIf you decide to change your LLMÂ\xa0system completely tomorrow for the same LLMÂ\xa0use case, your custom metrics shouldn\'t change at all, and vice versa. We\'ll talk more about the best strategy to choose your metrics later (spoiler: you don\'t want to have more than 5 metrics), but before that let\'s go through what makes great metrics great.\n\nGreat evaluation metrics are:\n\nSo the question becomes, how can LLM evaluation metrics compute reliable and accurate scores?\n\n## Different Ways to Compute Metric Scores\n\n[In one of my previous articles](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-testing-in-2024-top-methods-and-strategies), I talked about how LLM outputs are notoriously difficult to evaluate. Fortunately, there are numerous established methods available for calculating metric scoresâ\x80\x8aâ\x80\x94â\x80\x8asome utilize neural networks, including embedding models and LLMs, while others are based entirely on statistical analysis.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/67fb7c71b4111978e83854e9_llm-metrics.png)\n\nWeâ\x80\x99ll go through each method and talk about the best approach by the end of this section, so read on to find out!\n\n## Statistical Scorers\n\nBefore we begin, I want to start by saying statistical scoring methods in my opinion are non-essential to learn about, so feel free to skip straight to the â\x80\x9cG-Evalâ\x80\x9d section if youâ\x80\x99re in a rush. This is because statistical methods performs poorly whenever reasoning is required, making it too inaccurate as a scorer for most LLM evaluation criteria.\n\nTo quickly go through them:\n\nSince purely statistical scorers hardly not take any semantics into account and have extremely limited reasoning capabilities, they are not accurate enough for evaluating LLM outputs that are often long and complex. However, there are exceptions. For example, you\'ll learn later that the tool correctness metric which assess an LLM agent\'s tool calling accuracy (scroll down to the "Agentic Metrics" section at the bottom), uses exact-match with some conditional logic, but this is rare and should not be taken as the standard for LLM evals.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Confident AI:Â\xa0TheÂ\xa0DeepEval LLMÂ\xa0Evaluation Platform\n\nThe leading platform to evaluate and test LLMÂ\xa0applications on the cloud, native to DeepEval.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/661106881e9d2d02f5060281_maximize.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/67d56572dc72582cf7e7f90a_confident-red.svg)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Got Red?

In this section, it is more of the oppositeâ\x80\x8aâ\x80\x94â\x80\x8ascorers that purely rely on NLP models are comparably more accurate, but are also more unreliable due to their probabilistic nature.\n\nThis shouldn\'t be a surprise but, [scorers that are not LLM-based perform worse than LLM-as-a-judge](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/why-llm-as-a-judge-is-the-best-llm-evaluation-method), also due to the same reason stated for statistical scorers. Non-LLM scorers include:\n\nApart from inconsistent scores, the reality is there are several shortcomings of these approaches. For example, NLI scorers can also struggle with accuracy when processing long texts, while BLEURT are limited by the quality and representativeness of its training data.\n\nSo here we go, lets talk about [LLM judges](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/why-llm-as-a-judge-is-the-best-llm-evaluation-method) instead.\n\n#### G-Eval\n\nG-Eval is a recently developed framework from a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16634.pdf) titled â\x80\x9cNLG Evaluation using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignmentâ\x80\x9d that **uses LLMs to evaluate LLM outputs (aka. LLM-Evals), and is one the best ways to create task-specific metrics.**\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d400d6b269fd66427b7ef0_65ae098fe2f794d0e9bede8e_Screenshot%25202024-01-20%2520at%25203.03.25%2520PM.png)\n\nG-Eval ([docs here](https://www.deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals)) first generates a series of evaluation steps using chain of thoughts (CoTs) before using the generated steps to determine the final score via a form-filling paradigm (this is just a fancy way of saying G-Eval requires several pieces of information to work). For example, evaluating LLM output coherence using G-Eval involves constructing a prompt that contains the criteria and text to be evaluated to generate evaluation steps, before using an LLM to output a score from 1 to 5 based on these steps.\n\nLetâ\x80\x99s run through the G-Eval algorithm using this example. First, to generate evaluation steps:\n\n*(Note that in the original G-Eval paper, the authors only used GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for experiments, and having personally played around with different LLMs for G-Eval, I would highly recommend you stick with these models.)*\n\nAfter generating a series of evaluation steps:\n\nStep 3 is optional because to get the probability of the output tokens, you would need access to the raw model embeddings, which is not something guaranteed to be available for all model interfaces. This step however was introduced in the paper because it offers more fine-grained scores and minimizes bias in LLM scoring (as stated in the paper, 3 is known to have a higher token probability for a 1â\x80\x935 scale).\n\nHere are the results from the paper, which shows how G-Eval outperforms all traditional, non-LLM evals that were mentioned earlier in this article:\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d400d8b269fd66427b7f08_65ae09a9af1ae6c21abc2d68_Screenshot%25202024-01-14%2520at%252010.59.43%2520PM.png)\n\nG-Eval is great because as an LLM-Eval it is able to take the full semantics of LLM outputs into account, making it much more accurate. And this makes a lot of senseâ\x80\x8aâ\x80\x94â\x80\x8athink about it, how can non-LLM Evals, which uses scorers that are far less capable than LLMs, possibly understand the full scope of text generated by LLMs?\n\nAlthough G-Eval correlates much more with human judgment when compared to its counterparts, it can still be unreliable, as asking an LLM to come up with a score is indisputably arbitrary.\n\nThat being said, given how flexible G-Evalâ\x80\x99s evaluation criteria can be, Iâ\x80\x99ve personally implemented G-Eval as a metric for [DeepEval, an open-source LLM evaluation framework](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) Iâ\x80\x99ve been working on (which includes the normalization technique from the original paper). Â\n\n`# Install\npip install deepeval\n# Set OpenAI API key as env variable\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY="..."`\n`from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(input="input to your LLM", actual_output="your LLM output")\ncoherence_metric = GEval(\nname="Coherence",\ncriteria="Coherence - the collective quality of all sentences in the actual output",\nevaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\n)\ncoherence_metric.measure(test_case)\nprint(coherence_metric.score)\nprint(coherence_metric.reason)`\n\nG-Eval is one of the most popular ways to create LLM-as-a-judge metrics as it is simple, easy, and accurate. If you\'re interested, you can learn everything about G-Eval in full [here.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/g-eval-the-definitive-guide)\n\n#### DAGÂ\xa0(Deep AcyclicÂ\xa0Graph)\n\nG-Eval is great in the case of evaluation where **subjectivity** is involved. But when you have a clear success criteria, you\'ll want to use a scorer that is decision-based. Imagine this: you have a text summarization use case, where you wish to format a patient\'s medical history in a hospital setting. You\'ll need various headings in the summarization, in the correct order, and only assign it a perfect score if everything is formatted correctly. In this case, where it is extremely clear what you want the score to be for a certain combination of constraints, the DAG scorer is perfect.\n\nAs the name suggests, the [DAG (deep acyclic graph) scorer](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-dag) is a decision tree powered by LLM-as-a-judge, where each node is an LLM judgement and each edge is a decision. In the end, depending on the evaluation path taken, a final hard-coded score is returned (although you can also use G-Eval as a leaf node to return scores). By breaking evaluation into fine-grained steps, we achieve deterministically. Another use case for DAG is, to filter away edge cases where your LLMÂ\xa0output don\'t even meet the minimum requirement for evaluation. Back to our summarization example, this means an incorrect formatting, and often times you\'ll find yourself using G-Eval as a leaf node instead of a hard-coded score to return.\n\nYou can read more about why DAG works [this article here where I talk about LLM-as-a-judge](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/why-llm-as-a-judge-is-the-best-llm-evaluation-method) (highly recommended), but here is an example architecture of a DAG for text summarization:\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/67a853bbb60d78162968fe27_dag-diagram.png)\n\nAnd here is the corresponding code in DeepEval (documentation [here](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-dag)):\n\n`from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nfrom deepeval.metrics.dag import (\nDeepAcyclicGraph,\nTaskNode,\nBinaryJudgementNode,\nNonBinaryJudgementNode,\nVerdictNode,\n)\nfrom deepeval.metrics import DAGMetric\ncorrect_order_node = NonBinaryJudgementNode(\ncriteria="Are the summary headings in the correct order: \'intro\' => \'body\' => \'conclusion\'?",\nchildren=[\nVerdictNode(verdict="Yes", score=10),\nVerdictNode(verdict="Two are out of order", score=4),\nVerdictNode(verdict="All out of order", score=2),\n],\n)\ncorrect_headings_node = BinaryJudgementNode(\ncriteria="Does the summary headings contain all three: \'intro\', \'body\', and \'conclusion\'?",\nchildren=[\nVerdictNode(verdict=False, score=0),\nVerdictNode(verdict=True, child=correct_order_node),\n],\n)\nextract_headings_node = TaskNode(\ninstructions="Extract all headings in `actual_output`",\nevaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\noutput_label="Summary headings",\nchildren=[correct_headings_node, correct_order_node],\n)\n# create the DAG\ndag = DeepAcyclicGraph(root_nodes=[extract_headings_node])\n# create the metric\nformat_correctness = DAGMetric(name="Format Correctness", dag=dag)\n# create a test case\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(input="your-original-text", actual_output="your-summary")\n# evaluate\nformat_correctness.measure(test_case)\nprint(format_correctness.score, format_correctness.reason)`\n\nThe DAG metric is currently the most customizable metric available, and I built it to serve a lot of edge cases that wasn\'t covered by popular metrics such as answer relevancy, faithfulness, and even custom metrics such as G-Eval.\n\nâ\x80\x8d[Here is a fun read](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/how-i-built-deterministic-llm-evaluation-metrics-for-deepeval) more on the rationale behind building DeepEval\'s DAG metric.\n\n#### Prometheus\n\nPrometheus is a fully open-source LLM that is comparable to GPT-4â\x80\x99s evaluation capabilities when the appropriate reference materials (reference answer, score rubric) are provided. It is also use case agnostic, similar to G-Eval. Prometheus is a language model using [Llama-2-Chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf) as a base model and fine-tuned on 100K feedback (generated by GPT-4) within the [Feedback Collection](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kaist-ai/Feedback-Collection).\n\nHere are the brief results from the [prometheus research paper.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08491.pdf)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d400d78fa4a872b554eaf7_65ae0a296447926f5f649b4a_Screenshot%25202024-01-20%2520at%25203.07.50%2520PM.png)\n\nPrometheus follows the same principles as G-Eval. However, there are several differences:\n\nAlthough I personally havenâ\x80\x99t tried it, [Prometheus is available on hugging face](https://huggingface.co/kaist-ai/prometheus-13b-v1.0). The reason why I havenâ\x80\x99t tried implementing it is because Prometheus was designed to make evaluation open-source instead of depending on proprietary models such as OpenAIâ\x80\x99s GPTs. For someone aiming to build the best LLM-Evals available, it wasnâ\x80\x99t a good fit.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Confident AI:Â\xa0TheÂ\xa0DeepEval LLMÂ\xa0Evaluation Platform\n\nThe leading platform to evaluate and test LLMÂ\xa0applications on the cloud, native to DeepEval.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/661106881e9d2d02f5060281_maximize.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/67d56572dc72582cf7e7f90a_confident-red.svg)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Got Red?

Similar to the previous section, there are non-LLM scorers such as:\n\nBoth the BERTScore and MoverScore scorer is vulnerable to contextual awareness and bias due to their reliance on contextual embeddings from pre-trained models like BERT. But what about LLM-Evals?\n\n#### QAG Score\n\nQAG (Question Answer Generation) Score is a scorer that leverages LLMsâ\x80\x99 high reasoning capabilities to reliably evaluate LLM outputs. It uses confined answers (usually either a â\x80\x98yesâ\x80\x99 or â\x80\x98noâ\x80\x99) to close-ended questions (which can be generated or preset) to compute a final metric score. It is reliable because it does NOT use LLMs to directly generate scores. For example, if you want to compute a score for faithfulness (which measures whether an LLM output was hallucinated or not), you would:\n\nSo for this example LLM output:\n\nA claim would be:\n\nAnd a corresponding close-ended question would be:\n\nYou would then take this question, and ask whether the ground truth agrees with the claim. In the end, you will have a number of â\x80\x98yesâ\x80\x99 and â\x80\x98noâ\x80\x99 answers, which you can use to compute a score via some mathematical formula of your choice.\n\nIn the case of faithfulness, if we define it as as the proportion of claims in an LLM output that are accurate and consistent with the ground truth, it Â\xa0can easily be calculated by dividing the number of accurate (truthful) claims by the total number of claims made by the LLM. Since we are not using LLMs to directly generate evaluation scores but still leveraging its superior reasoning ability, we get scores that are both accurate and reliable.\n\n#### GPTScore\n\nUnlike G-Eval which directly performs the evaluation task with a form-filling paradigm, [GPTScore uses the conditional probability of generating the target text as an evaluation metric.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04166.pdf)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d400d78fa4a872b554eaf4_65ae0a62944fc078c30d94b2_Screenshot%25202024-01-16%2520at%252012.12.40%2520AM.png)\n\n#### SelfCheckGPT\n\nSelfCheckGPT is an odd one. [It is a simple sampling-based approach that is used to fact-check LLM outputs.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08896.pdf) It assumes that Â\xa0hallucinated outputs are not reproducible, whereas if an LLM has knowledge of a given concept, sampled responses are likely to be similar and contain consistent facts.\n\nSelfCheckGPT is an interesting approach because it makes detecting hallucination a reference-less process, which is extremely useful in a production setting.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d400d8b269fd66427b7f05_65ae0a6ef4f934569e0a2321_Screenshot%25202024-01-20%2520at%25203.17.26%2520PM.png)\n\nHowever, although youâ\x80\x99ll notice that G-Eval and Prometheus is use case agnostic, SelfCheckGPT is not. It is only suitable for hallucination detection, and not for evaluating other use cases such as summarization, coherence, etc.\n\n## Choosing Your Evaluation Metrics\n\nThe choice of which LLM evaluation metric to use depends on the use case and architecture of your LLM application. Our experience tells us that you don\'t want more than 5 LLM evaluation metrics in your evaluation pipeline. As you\'ll see later, most metrics look extremely attractive - I mean, who doesn\'t want to prevent biases for their internal RAGÂ\xa0QAÂ\xa0app? But the truth is, when you\'re evaluating everything, you\'re evaluating nothing at all.\n\nToo much data != good. You\'ll want:\n\nThese are rough numbers and it depends on the complexity of your system. For example, if youâ\x80\x99re building a RAG-based customer support chatbot on top of OpenAIâ\x80\x99s models with tool calling capabilities, youâ\x80\x99ll want 3 RAG metrics (eg., faithfulness, answer relevancy, contextual relevancy) and 1 agentic metric (e.g. tool correctness) to evaluate the system, and 1 custom metric built using G-Eval that evaluates something like brand voice or helpfulness. Here is a nice diagram that summarizes the metrics selection process:\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/67fb8805912852054954c64e_metrics-flowchart.png)\n\nAnother useful tip of deciding whether to use G-Eval or DAG is, if the criteria is purely subjective, use G-Eval. Otherwise use DAG. I say "purely", because you can also use G-Eval as one of the nodes in DAG.\n\nIn this final section, weâ\x80\x99ll be going over the evaluation metrics you absolutely need to know. *(And as a bonus, the implementation of each.)*\n\n## RAG Metrics\n\nFor those donâ\x80\x99t already know what RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is, [here is a great read](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation). But in a nutshell, RAG serves as a method to supplement LLMs with extra context to generate tailored outputs, and is great for building chatbots. It is made up of two componentsâ\x80\x8aâ\x80\x94â\x80\x8athe retriever, and the generator.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d400d8b269fd66427b7f0c_65ae0a82bfd1aa5d9a746c70_Screenshot%25202024-01-20%2520at%25203.36.12%2520PM.png)\n\nHereâ\x80\x99s how a RAG workflow typically works:\n\nHereâ\x80\x99s one thing to rememberâ\x80\x8aâ\x80\x94â\x80\x8a**high quality LLM outputs is the product of a great retriever and generator.** For this reason, great RAG metrics focuses on evaluating either your RAG retriever or generator in a reliable and accurate way. (In fact, [RAG metrics were originally designed to be reference-less metrics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15217.pdf), meaning they donâ\x80\x99t require ground truths, making them usable even in a production setting.)\n\n**PS. For those looking to unit test RAG systems in CI/CD pipelines,** [**click here.**](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/how-to-evaluate-rag-applications-in-ci-cd-pipelines-with-deepeval)\n\n#### Faithfulness\n\nFaithfulness is a RAG metric that evaluates whether the LLM/generator in your RAG pipeline is generating LLM outputs that factually aligns with the information presented in the retrieval context. But which scorer should we use for the faithfulness metric?\n\n**Spoiler alert: The QAG Scorer is the best scorer for RAG metrics since it excels for evaluation tasks where the objective is clear.** For faithfulness, if you define it as the proportion of truthful claims made in an LLM output with regards to the retrieval context, we can calculate faithfulness using QAG by following this algorithm:\n\nThis method ensures accuracy by using LLMâ\x80\x99s advanced reasoning capabilities while avoiding unreliability in LLM generated scores, making it a better scoring method than G-Eval.\n\nIf you feel this is too complicated to implement, you can use [DeepEval. Itâ\x80\x99s an open-source package I built and offers all the evaluation metrics you need for LLM evaluation, including the faithfulness metric](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval).\n\n`# Install\npip install deepeval\n# Set OpenAI API key as env variable\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY="..."`\n`from deepeval.metrics import FaithfulnessMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\ntest_case=LLMTestCase(\ninput="...",\nactual_output="...",\nretrieval_context=["..."]\n)\nmetric = FaithfulnessMetric(threshold=0.5)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score)\nprint(metric.reason)\nprint(metric.is_successful())`\n\nDeepEval treats evaluation as test cases. Here, actual\\_output is simply your LLM output. Also, since faithfulness is an LLM-Eval, youâ\x80\x99re able to get a reasoning for the final calculated score.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Confident AI:Â\xa0TheÂ\xa0DeepEval LLMÂ\xa0Evaluation Platform\n\nThe leading platform to evaluate and test LLMÂ\xa0applications on the cloud, native to DeepEval.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/661106881e9d2d02f5060281_maximize.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/67d56572dc72582cf7e7f90a_confident-red.svg)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Got Red?

Hereâ\x80\x99s an implementation of the answer relevancy metric:\n\n`from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\ntest_case=LLMTestCase(\ninput="...",\nactual_output="...",\nretrieval_context=["..."]\n)\nmetric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score)\nprint(metric.reason)\nprint(metric.is_successful())`\n\n*(Remember, weâ\x80\x99re using QAG for all RAG metrics)*\n\n#### Contextual Precision\n\nContextual Precision is a RAG metric that assesses the quality of your RAG pipelineâ\x80\x99s retriever. When weâ\x80\x99re talking about contextual metrics, weâ\x80\x99re mainly concerned about the relevancy of the retrieval context. A high contextual precision score means nodes that are relevant in the retrieval contextual are ranked higher than irrelevant ones. This is important because LLMs gives more weighting to information in nodes that appear earlier in the retrieval context, which affects the quality of the final output.\n\n`from deepeval.metrics import ContextualPrecisionMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\ntest_case=LLMTestCase(\ninput="...",\nactual_output="...",\n# Expected output is the "ideal" output of your LLM, it is an\n# extra parameter that\'s needed for contextual metrics\nexpected_output="...",\nretrieval_context=["..."]\n)\nmetric = ContextualPrecisionMetric(threshold=0.5)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score)\nprint(metric.reason)\nprint(metric.is_successful())`\n\n#### Contextual Recall\n\nContextual Precision is an additional metric for evaluating a Retriever-Augmented Generator (RAG). It is calculated by determining the proportion of sentences in the expected output or ground truth that can be attributed to nodes in the retrieval context. A higher score represents a greater alignment between the retrieved information and the expected output, indicating that the retriever is effectively sourcing relevant and accurate content to aid the generator in producing contextually appropriate responses.\n\n`from deepeval.metrics import ContextualRecallMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\ntest_case=LLMTestCase(\ninput="...",\nactual_output="...",\n# Expected output is the "ideal" output of your LLM, it is an\n# extra parameter that\'s needed for contextual metrics\nexpected_output="...",\nretrieval_context=["..."]\n)\nmetric = ContextualRecallMetric(threshold=0.5)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score)\nprint(metric.reason)\nprint(metric.is_successful())`\n\n#### Contextual Relevancy\n\nProbably the simplest metric to understand, contextual relevancy is simply the proportion of sentences in the retrieval context that are relevant to a given input.\n\n`from deepeval.metrics import ContextualRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\ntest_case=LLMTestCase(\ninput="...",\nactual_output="...",\nretrieval_context=["..."]\n)\nmetric = ContextualRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score)\nprint(metric.reason)\nprint(metric.is_successful())`\n\n## AgenticÂ\xa0Metrics\n\nIf you\'re new to LLM agent evaluation, check this [complete agent evaluation guide](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-agent-evaluation-complete-guide) that goes in much more depth. Here, we\'ll go through the common metrics you\'ll likely require if your system involves agentic workflows.\n\n#### Tool Correctness\n\nTool correctness is an agentic metric that assesses the quality of your agentic systems, and is the most unusual metric here because it is based on exact matching and not any LLM-as-a-judge. It is computed by comparing the tools called for a given input to the expected tools that should be called:\n\n`from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, ToolCall\nfrom deepeval.metrics import ToolCorrectnessMetric\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\ninput="What if these shoes don\'t fit?",\nactual_output="We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.",\n# Replace this with the tools that was actually used by your LLM agent\ntools_called=[ToolCall(name="WebSearch"), ToolCall(name="ToolQuery")],\nexpected_tools=[ToolCall(name="WebSearch")],\n)\nmetric = ToolCorrectnessMetric()\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score, metric.reason)`\n\nIn this example, the tools are "WebSearch" and "ToolQuery". You can find the docs for this metric [here.](https://www.deepeval.com/docs/metrics-tool-correctness)\n\n#### Task Completion\n\nTask completion is an agentic metric that uses LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate whether your LLM agent is able to accomplish its given task. The given task is inferred from the input it was provided with to kickstart the agentic workflow, while the entire execution process is used to determine the degree of completion of such task.\n\n`from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nfrom deepeval.metrics import TaskCompletionMetric\nmetric = TaskCompletionMetric(\nthreshold=0.7,\nmodel="gpt-4o",\ninclude_reason=True\n)\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\ninput="Plan a 3-day itinerary for Paris with cultural landmarks and local cuisine.",\nactual_output=(\n"Day 1: Eiffel Tower, dinner at Le Jules Verne. "\n"Day 2: Louvre Museum, lunch at Angelina Paris. "\n"Day 3: Montmartre, evening at a wine bar."\n),\ntools_called=[\nToolCall(\nname="Itinerary Generator",\ndescription="Creates travel plans based on destination and duration.",\ninput_parameters={"destination": "Paris", "days": 3},\noutput=[\n"Day 1: Eiffel Tower, Le Jules Verne.",\n"Day 2: Louvre Museum, Angelina Paris.",\n"Day 3: Montmartre, wine bar.",\n],\n),\nToolCall(\nname="Restaurant Finder",\ndescription="Finds top restaurants in a city.",\ninput_parameters={"city": "Paris"},\noutput=["Le Jules Verne", "Angelina Paris", "local wine bars"],\n),\n],\n)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score, metric.reason)`\n\nFull documentation for more comprehensive examples [available on DeepEval\'s docs.](https://www.deepeval.com/docs/metrics-task-completion)\n\n## Fine-Tuning Metrics\n\nWhen I say â\x80\x9cfine-tuning metricsâ\x80\x9d, what I really mean is metrics that assess the LLM itself, rather than the entire system. Putting aside cost and performance benefits, LLMs are often fine-tuned to either:\n\nIf you\'re looking to fine-tune your own models, here is a [step-by-step tutorial on how to fine-tune LLaMA-2](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-fine-tune-llama-2-with-llm-evaluations) in under 2 hours, all within Google Colab, with evaluations.\n\n#### Hallucination\n\nSome of you might recognize this being the same as the faithfulness metric. Although similar, hallucination in fine-tuning is more complicated since it is often difficult to pinpoint the exact ground truth for a given output. To go around this problem, we can take advantage of SelfCheckGPTâ\x80\x99s zero-shot approach to sample the proportion of hallucinated sentences in an LLM output.\n\n`from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\ntest_case=LLMTestCase(\ninput="...",\nactual_output="...",\n# Note that \'context\' is not the same as \'retrieval_context\'.\n# While retrieval context is more concerned with RAG pipelines,\n# context is the ideal retrieval results for a given input,\n# and typically resides in the dataset used to fine-tune your LLM\ncontext=["..."],\n)\nmetric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.5)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score)\nprint(metric.is_successful())`\n\nHowever, this approach can get very expensive, so for now I would suggest using an NLI scorer and manually provide some context as the ground truth instead.\n\n#### Toxicity\n\nThe toxicity metric evaluates the extent to which a text contains offensive, harmful, or inappropriate language. Off-the-shelf pre-trained models like Detoxify, which utilize the BERT scorer, can be employed to score toxicity.\n\n`from deepeval.metrics import ToxicityMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nmetric = ToxicityMetric(threshold=0.5)\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\ninput="What if these shoes don\'t fit?",\n# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\nactual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."\n)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score)`\n\nHowever, this method can be inaccurate since words â\x80\x9cassociated with swearing, insults or profanity are present in a comment, is likely to be classified as toxic, regardless of the tone or the intent of the author e.g. humorous/self-deprecatingâ\x80\x9d.\n\nIn this case, you might want to consider using G-Eval instead to define a custom criteria for toxicity. In fact, the use case agnostic nature of G-Eval the main reason why I like it so much.\n\n`from deepeval.metrics import GEval\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\ninput="What if these shoes don\'t fit?",\n# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\nactual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."\n)\ntoxicity_metric = GEval(\nname="Toxicity",\ncriteria="Toxicity - determine if the actual outout contains any non-humorous offensive, harmful, or inappropriate language",\nevaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\n)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score)`\n\n#### Bias\n\nThe bias metric evaluates aspects such as political, gender, and social biases in textual content. This is particularly crucial for applications where a custom LLM is involved in decision-making processes. For example, aiding in bank loan approvals with unbiased recommendations, or in recruitment, where it assists in determining if a candidate should be shortlisted for an interview.\n\nSimilar to toxicity, bias can be evaluated using G-Eval. (But donâ\x80\x99t get me wrong, QAG can also be a viable scorer for metrics like toxicity and bias.)\n\n`from deepeval.metrics import GEval\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\ninput="What if these shoes don\'t fit?",\n# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\nactual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."\n)\ntoxicity_metric = GEval(\nname="Bias",\ncriteria="Bias - determine if the actual output contains any racial, gender, or political bias.",\nevaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\n)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score)`\n\nBias is a highly subjective matter, varying significantly across different geographical, geopolitical, and geosocial environments. For example, language or expressions considered neutral in one culture may carry different connotations in another. *(This is also why few-shot evaluation doesnâ\x80\x99t work well for bias.)*\n\nA potential solution would be to fine-tune a custom LLM for evaluation or provide extremely clear rubrics for in-context learning, and for this reason, I believe bias is the hardest metric of all to implement.\n\n## Use Case Specific Metrics\n\n#### Helpfulness\n\nA custom helpfulness metric assesses whether your LLM app is able to be of use to users interacting with it. When a criteria is so subjective, it. is best to use G-Eval:\n\n`from deepeval.metrics import GEval\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams\nhelpfulness = GEval(\nname="Helpfulness",\ncriteria="Determine whether the `actual output` is helpful in answering the `input`.",\nevaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],\n)\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\ninput="What if these shoes don\'t fit?",\n# Replace this with the actual output of your LLM app\nactual_output"We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."\n)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score, metric.reason)`\n\nFull example on G-Eval implementation [here](https://www.deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals).\n\n#### Prompt Alignment\n\nThe prompt alignment metric assesses whether yourÂ\xa0LLM is able to generate text according to the instructions laid out in your prompt template.Â\xa0The algorithm is simple yet effective, we first:\n\nThis works because instead of supplying the entire prompt to the metric, we only supply the list of instructions, which means your judge LLMÂ\xa0instead of having to take in the entire prompt as context (which can be lengthy and cause hallucinations), it just has to consider one instruction at a time when making a verdict on whether an instruction is followed.\n\n`from deepeval.metrics import PromptAlignmentMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nmetric = PromptAlignmentMetric(\nprompt_instructions=["Reply in all uppercase"],\nmodel="gpt-4",\ninclude_reason=True\n)\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\ninput="What if these shoes don\'t fit?",\n# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\nactual_output="We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."\n)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score, metric.reason)`\n\nDocumentation on this metric can be found [here](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-prompt-alignment).\n\n#### Summarization\n\nI actually covered the summarization metric in depth in [one of my previous articles, so I would highly recommend to give it a good read](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/a-step-by-step-guide-to-evaluating-an-llm-text-summarization-task) (and I promise its much shorter than this article).\n\nIn summary (no pun intended), all good summaries:\n\nUsing QAG, we can calculate both factual alignment and inclusion scores to compute a final summarization score. In DeepEval, we take the minimum of the two intermediary scores as the final summarization score.\n\n`from deepeval.metrics import SummarizationMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\n# This is the original text to be summarized\ninput = """\nThe \'inclusion score\' is calculated as the percentage of assessment questions\nfor which both the summary and the original document provide a \'yes\' answer. This\nmethod ensures that the summary not only includes key information from the original\ntext but also accurately represents it. A higher inclusion score indicates a\nmore comprehensive and faithful summary, signifying that the summary effectively\nencapsulates the crucial points and details from the original content.\n"""\n# This is the summary, replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\nactual_output="""\nThe inclusion score quantifies how well a summary captures and\naccurately represents key information from the original text,\nwith a higher score indicating greater comprehensiveness.\n"""\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(input=input, actual_output=actual_output)\nmetric = SummarizationMetric(threshold=0.5)\nmetric.measure(test_case)\nprint(metric.score)`\n\nAdmittedly, I havenâ\x80\x99t done the summarization metric enough justice because I donâ\x80\x99t want to make this article longer than it already is. But for those interested, I would highly recommend reading [this article](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/a-step-by-step-guide-to-evaluating-an-llm-text-summarization-task) to learn more about building your own summarization metric using QAG.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations for making to the end! It has been a long list of scorers and metrics, and I hope you now know all the different factors you need to consider and choices you have to make when picking a metric for LLM evaluation.\n\nThe main objective of an LLM evaluation metric is to quantify the performance of your LLM (application), and to do this we have different scorers, with some better than others. For LLM evaluation, scorers that uses LLMs (G-Eval, Prometheus, SelfCheckGPT, and QAG) are most accurate due to their high reasoning capabilities, but we need to take extra pre-cautions to ensure these scores are reliable.\n\nAt the end of the day, the choice of metrics depend on your use case and implementation of your LLM application, where RAG and fine-tuning metrics are a great starting point to evaluating LLM outputs. For more use case specific metrics, you can use G-Eval with few-shot prompting for the most accurate results.\n\nDonâ\x80\x99t forget to give [â\xad\x90 DeepEval a star on Github â\xad\x90](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) if you found this article useful, and as always, till next time.\n\nDo you want to brainstorm how to evaluate your LLM (application)?

As LLMs run many AI applications and technologies, such as AI copilots, AI Agnets, and speech recognition technologies, evaluation of LLM performance, accuracy, and efficiency is key. In this article, we will provide technical details on how LLMs are evaluated.\n\nA thorough evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial to measure their effectiveness and ensure these advanced systems meet the high bar for their many LLM use cases. To do this precise LLM evaluation metrics are needed.\n\nWhat is LLM Evaluation?\n-----------------------\n\nLLM evaluation is a complex process to assess the capabilities and functionalities of large language models. The evaluation framework helps identify strengths and weaknesses, guiding developers in refining models and selecting the best fit for specific project requirements. Let’s start with a brief but comprehensive overview of LLM accuracy.\n\n### Importance of LLM Accuracy\n\nIn the current landscape large language models are being applied to many sectors. This includes the integration of [large language models in healthcare](https://aisera.com/blog/large-language-models-healthcare/), a pivotal development that is reshaping the industry. Also, LLMs are being employed in [banking](https://aisera.com/blog/large-language-models-in-financial-services-banking/) and [AI customer service](https://aisera.com/products/ai-customer-service/) to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. So it’s important to regularly evaluate these models to ensure their accuracy and reliability to produce valid responses avoid [AI mistakes](https://aisera.com/blog/ai-mistakes/) and reduce [AI hallucinations](https://aisera.com/blog/ai-hallucination/).\n\nThe core of LLM performance evaluation is to understand the effectiveness of the [foundation models](https://aisera.com/blog/foundation-models/). This is done by testing against evaluation datasets which are designed to push the limits of an LLM or model’s performance, accuracy, fluency, and relevance. This deep analysis shows how the model processes and generates language, for applications from question answering to content creation.\n\nMoving to system evaluation we look at specific components within the LLM framework such as prompts and contexts which are crucial for real world application of these models. Tools like OpenAI’s Eval library and open source libraries such as [Hugging Face’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugging_Face) platforms provide valuable resources to evaluate the foundation models. These tools not only enable comparison but also give developers the empirical evidence to [fine-tune LLMs](https://aisera.com/blog/fine-tuning-llms/) for their use cases.\n\nHow to evaluate LLMs is as much about refining the algorithms underneath as it is about the final integration in a specific context to be seamless and productive. Choosing the right model is key as it’s the foundation upon which businesses and developers can build innovative and reliable solutions that meet user requirements in this ever changing tech landscape.\n\n![Image 42: How to evaluate LLMs?](https://aisera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/llms-evaluation-1024x538.jpg)\n\nLLM Evaluation Framework\n------------------------\n\n### LLM Evaluation Framework\n\nAs we get deeper into artificial intelligence, [Agentic AI](https://aisera.com/blog/agentic-ai/) systems and large language models are having more and more impact across industries. After [LLM security](https://aisera.com/blog/llm-security/) concerns have been addressed, the focus shifts to ensuring these models perform reliably across various tasks and domains. To understand why evaluating LLMs is so important we need to think about the breadth of applications for LLMs and how that is outpacing traditional feedback mechanisms to monitor their performance. The LLM evaluation process is necessary for several reasons.\n\nFirstly it provides a window into the model’s reliability and speed – the two key factors that determine how an AI will perform in real world. Without robust and current evaluation methods you will have inaccuracies and inefficiencies going unchecked which will lead to poor user experience. Evaluating LLMs gives businesses and practitioners the insights to tune these models so they are properly calibrated to serve the AI and the specific needs of their deployments.\n\n### CLASSic Framework\n\nAisera, a leader in Agentic AI for Fortune 500 companies, introduces the CLASSic Framework, a framework to benchmark enterprise AI agents across 5 areas. **Cost** is the operational expense of the agent, including API usage, tokens, and infrastructure. **Latency** is the end to end response time, how fast the task gets executed. **Accuracy** is the precision of workflow selection and execution. **Stability** is the robustness of the model across different inputs, domains and operational conditions. **Security** is the resistance to adversarial inputs, prompt injection and data leaks. This framework provides a data driven way to optimize AI agent performance in real world enterprise use cases.\n\nWhat LLM Evaluation Metrics Are?\n--------------------------------\n\nRecognizing the diversity of applications that modern large language models serve, it becomes evident that a one-size-fits-all approach to LLM performance evaluation is impractical. Rather, the large language model evaluation process must adapt to the intricacies of various use cases, employing tailored LLM evaluation metrics that accurately reflect the unique demands of each scenario.\n\n### Context-Specific Evaluation\n\nWhen deploying LLMs in education, for instance, developers meticulously examine the age-appropriateness of the model’s responses, as well as their propensity to avoid toxic outputs. Similarly, consumer-facing applications may prioritize response relevance and the capacity of a model to sustain coherent and engaging interactions. All these evaluation points are influenced significantly by the selection and structuring of the LLM prompts and contexts.\n\n*   **Relevance**: Does the LLM provide information pertinent to the user’s query?\n*   **Hallucination**: Is the model prone to generating factually incorrect or illogical statements? Is the model prone to generating factually incorrect or illogical statements? What improvements can be made to reduce [AI hallucinations](https://aisera.com/blog/ai-hallucination/)?\n*   **Question-answering accuracy**: How effectively can the LLM handle direct user inquiries?\n*   **Toxicity**: Are the model outputs clear of offensive or harmful content?\n*   **Bleu score**: The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score measures the similarity between a machine-generated text and a reference human translation. It evaluates how closely the machine output matches the human reference, often used in translation tasks.\n*   **Rouge score**: The ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score is a set of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translations. It focuses on recall, assessing how much of the reference content is captured in the generated summary or translation.\n\n### Advanced Evaluation Techniques\n\nEncapsulated in tools like the Phoenix evaluation framework, these considerations form the bedrock of a robust evaluation system, emphasizing the significance of contextual relevance in the dynamic between question and reference texts.\n\nLLM Evaluation Metric Relevance to Use Case Tools for Measurement\nAge Appropriateness Essential for educational content aimed at children Content filtering algorithms, manual expert reviews\nResponse Relevance Crucial for customer service bots and information retrieval systems Relevance scoring based on user interaction data\nAccuracy in Question-Answering Key in research, analytical tasks, and educational applications Automated QA testing, human evaluation, community feedback\nMinimization of Toxicity Vital for all public-facing applications Toxicity detection software, sentiment analysis tools\n\n### User Experience Metrics\n\nBeyond these primary metrics, evaluating the overall user experience is crucial. This involves assessing how intuitive and user-friendly the LLM is, which includes:\n\n*   **Response Time**: How quickly does the LLM generate responses?\n*   **User Satisfaction**: Are users satisfied with the interactions? This can be measured through feedback and engagement metrics.\n*   **Error Recovery**: How well does the LLM handle errors or misunderstandings? Effective error recovery mechanisms enhance user trust and reliability.\n\nGuided by specific use cases, LLM system evaluation transcends mere number-crunching. It is an exercise in understanding the nuanced requirements of various applications, thereby shaping a more inclusive and responsible approach to AI development and implementation.\n\n![Image 43: LLMs performance benchmark & metrics](https://aisera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/large-language-model-benchmark-metrics-1024x538.jpg)\n\nModel Evaluation Templates\n--------------------------\n\nYou can choose a variety of prompt templates for evaluating your fine-tuned large language model using the LLM Eval module.\n\n### 1- General\n\nThe General template provides a standardized framework for evaluating language models and comparing fine-tuned model responses to reference scores. It utilizes common NLP metrics to assess the overall performance and accuracy of the generated outputs.\n\n### 2- TruthfulQA\n\nThe [TruthfulQA](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA) template assesses a model’s performance based on the TruthfulQA benchmark, which evaluates how models avoid generating false responses. It ensures models generate truthful answers, avoiding human-like falsehoods, and uses zero-shot generative tasks to measure response quality.\n\n### 3- LLM-as-a-Judge\n\nThe [LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) template uses a strong LLM to evaluate the outputs of another LLM, leveraging AI to assess the quality of responses. The model acts as a judge, comparing predicted outputs against ideal responses, and scores them using methods like LangChain’s CriteriaEvalChain.\n\nApplications of LLM Evaluation\n------------------------------\n\nThe rigorous assessment of LLMs is more than an academic exercise; it is a business imperative in a data-driven world. Measuring the capabilities and limitations of LLMs with precise evaluation metrics enables us to harness their full potential, optimize their application in diverse fields, and ensure they serve our objectives effectively.\n\n### Performance Assessment\n\nIn assessing the performance of LLMs, a range of metrics are utilized to understand how effectively these models interpret human language and provide accurate responses.

Traditional metrics fail to capture the nuanced capabilities of these complex systems, creating significant business risks. The right benchmarking approach is no longer optional—it\'s essential for responsible AI deployment.\n\nThis guide explores seven key LLM benchmark categories, evaluation methodologies, and industry-specific requirements to help you build a robust [evaluation framework](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/building-an-effective-llm-evaluation-framework-from-scratch) tailored to your organization\'s needs.\n\nWhat is LLM Benchmarking?\n-------------------------\n\nLLM benchmarking is the systematic process of [evaluating large language models](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/mastering-llm-evaluation-metrics-frameworks-and-techniques) against standardized frameworks to assess their performance across various tasks and capabilities.\n\nUnlike traditional machine learning evaluation, which typically measures accuracy on well-defined tasks with clear ground truths, LLM benchmarking must contend with the inherent complexity of generative models that produce diverse, creative, and often non-deterministic outputs.\n\nWhen benchmarking traditional ML models, you can usually rely on straightforward [metrics like accuracy, precision, or F1 scores](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/accuracy-metrics-ai-evaluation) against established ground truths. However, for LLMs, the evaluation landscape is fundamentally different. These models generate original text that can vary significantly with each run, even with identical inputs, making consistent evaluation challenging.\n\nThe unique challenges of evaluating LLMs include:\n\nTo address these complex challenges, the AI community has developed specialized benchmarking categories with different methodologies:\n\nLet\'s examine these categories of LLM benchmarks in more detail, beginning with those designed to evaluate general language understanding capabilities.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #1: General Language Understanding Benchmarks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral-purpose benchmarks provide standardized evaluations of core LLM capabilities across fundamental linguistic tasks. [GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)](https://gluebenchmark.com/) establishes an entry-level standard with nine tasks spanning sentiment analysis, grammatical acceptability, and textual similarity, creating a foundation for basic competency testing.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, [SuperGLUE](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) introduces more challenging tasks that require complex reasoning, including sophisticated question answering, natural language inference, and coreference resolution, designed to expose limitations invisible in simpler evaluations.\n\nFor assessing breadth of knowledge, [MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mmlu) tests models across 57 subjects ranging from STEM to humanities, evaluating zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities in multiple-choice format to reveal how effectively models generalize knowledge across diverse domains.\n\nThe expansive [BIG-Bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) collection incorporates over 200 tasks from traditional NLP challenges to novel assessments requiring logical reasoning, multilingual understanding, and creative thinking, providing comprehensive coverage of language capabilities.\n\nTaking a more holistic approach, [HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models)](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/) evaluates models across multiple dimensions including scenarios, metrics, and capabilities, moving beyond accuracy to consider fairness, bias, and toxicity for more comprehensive assessment.\n\n[Case studies analysis of these benchmarks](https://medium.com/@InsightfulEnginner/understanding-benchmarking-in-nlp-glue-superglue-helm-mmlu-and-big-bench-2e0a55b57d3b) shows they\'ve driven research toward developing models with stronger reasoning abilities and factual knowledge, while simultaneously revealing persistent gaps in areas requiring deep contextual understanding and common sense reasoning that challenge even state-of-the-art models.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #2: Knowledge and Factuality Benchmarks\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKnowledge and factuality benchmarks evaluate an LLM\'s ability to provide [AI truthfulness](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/truthful-ai-reliable-qa) and avoid generating false content. [TruthfulQA](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA) challenges models with questions designed to elicit common misconceptions, assessing their resistance to generating falsehoods even when prompted in misleading ways.\n\nThe [FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification) benchmark](https://www.amazon.science/code-and-datasets/fever-fact-extraction-and-verification) further tests LLMs\' verification abilities by requiring models to classify statements as supported, refuted, or having insufficient evidence based on provided context, while NaturalQuestions uses real Google search queries to measure factual recall across diverse domains.\n\nModern factuality evaluation increasingly employs reference-free methods like self-consistency checks and hallucination detection metrics that identify when models generate plausible but unfounded claims, eliminating the need for gold-standard answers. [Research shows strong correlations between automated factuality metrics and human judgments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17002), with QA Generation Scoring (QAG) demonstrating particular effectiveness by breaking claims into verifiable questions and then evaluating answers.\n\nTaking a more holistic approach, the [FACTS Grounding benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03200) revealed that even leading LLMs struggle with consistent factuality, showing a tendency to "hallucinate" additional details beyond provided context, with factuality scores dropping significantly when models produce detailed, domain-specific responses in specialized fields like medicine and law.\n\nImplementing effective factuality metrics typically involves multi-step processes combining claim extraction, evidence retrieval, and verification, with technologies like [embedding-based similarity measurements](https://medium.com/@kvrware/embedding-similarity-search-25c6911240af) and natural language inference enabling more comprehensive assessment at scale than traditional methods focused on exact matches.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #3: Reasoning and Problem-Solving Benchmarks\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReasoning benchmarks assess an LLM\'s ability to solve problems step-by-step, mirroring human-like logical thought processes. Key examples include [GSM8K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k) and [MATH](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/math-word-problem-solving-on-math) for arithmetic reasoning, [Big Bench Hard (BBH)](https://github.com/suzgunmirac/BIG-Bench-Hard) for diverse reasoning tasks, and MMLU\'s specialized subsections that evaluate causal, deductive, and inductive reasoning abilities.\n\nThese benchmarks simulate real-world scenarios where logical progression is crucial, testing whether models can decompose complex problems into manageable steps. For instance, GSM8K\'s mathematical word problems require not just computational ability but understanding context and relationships between variables.\n\n[Chain-of-thought evaluation methodologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261) have revolutionized reasoning assessment by asking models to verbalize their thinking process. This approach, pioneered by DeepMind and Google Research, evaluates both the final answer and the reasoning path, revealing whether models truly understand problems or merely pattern-match to solutions.\n\nInterestingly, these [critical thinking benchmarks](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/best-benchmarks-for-evaluating-llms-critical-thinking-abilities) show stronger correlation with real-world problem-solving capabilities than many other metrics. Organizations implementing LLMs for complex decisions have found that models performing well on reasoning benchmarks typically provide more reliable assistance in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and legal analysis.\n\nHowever, despite significant progress, certain reasoning tasks remain challenging even for frontier models. Multi-hop reasoning involving counterfactuals, complex causal relationships, and novel problem structures often trips up advanced LLMs. These limitations exist because models struggle with truly abstract reasoning beyond their training distribution.\n\nThe frontier of reasoning benchmarks now focuses on evaluative tasks that require judgment across competing considerations and self-correction abilities when faced with contradictions or new information. Models that can identify and remedy their own reasoning errors represent the next breakthrough in artificial reasoning.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #4: Coding and Technical Capability Benchmarks\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCoding benchmarks evaluate an LLM\'s ability to generate functional, efficient, and secure code. [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval) and [MBPP (Mostly Basic Programming Problems)](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/mbpp/README.md) assess Python coding skills through problem-solving tasks, with HumanEval focusing on more complex algorithmic challenges and MBPP targeting simpler programming tasks.\n\n[CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE) expands beyond basic coding to evaluate code-to-code translation, bug fixing, and code completion capabilities across multiple programming languages. [DS-1000](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11501) specifically targets data science libraries like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), measuring an LLM\'s ability to solve domain-specific programming challenges.\n\n[Functional correctness](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/functional-correctness-modern-ai) remains another primary evaluation metric, typically measured by pass@k rates that indicate how often a model generates working solutions within k attempts. This approach requires sandboxed execution environments that safely run generated code against test cases while protecting against malicious code execution.\n\nBeyond basic correctness, advanced evaluation frameworks examine code efficiency, measuring execution time and memory usage. Security analysis identifies potential vulnerabilities like SQL injection risks, while static analysis tools evaluate code style and adherence to best practices – areas where industry leaders like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [Replit](https://replit.com/) develop specific benchmarks.\n\nThe most challenging aspect of code evaluation lies in assessing code quality beyond basic functionality. While pass/fail tests verify correctness, they don\'t measure readability, maintainability, or elegance. Industry benchmarks increasingly incorporate test comprehensiveness metrics to ensure solutions work across diverse inputs and edge cases.\n\nImplementation of effective code evaluation frameworks requires careful design of test suites with comprehensive coverage, timeouts to prevent infinite loops, and memory limits to avoid resource exhaustion. This multi-faceted approach enables increasingly sophisticated assessment of LLMs\' technical problem-solving capabilities as these models continue to evolve.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #5: Ethical and Safety Benchmarks\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nSafety benchmarks systematically evaluate models\' responses to potentially harmful inputs and instructions across multiple dimensions. TruthfulQA assesses a model\'s propensity to generate false information by measuring whether it avoids reproducing common misconceptions or fabricating "facts" that humans might believe, revealing that larger models sometimes score worse on truthfulness despite superior performance in other areas.\n\n[AdvBench (Adversarial Benchmark)](https://github.com/thunlp/Advbench) tests resilience against jailbreaking attempts through inputs specifically designed to bypass safety guardrails using techniques like prefix injection, role-playing scenarios, and complex hypotheticals, providing critical insights into vulnerability patterns across different model architectures.\n\n[RealToxicityPrompts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/real-toxicity-prompts) further evaluates how models handle inputs containing offensive language by measuring dimensions including profanity, identity attacks, and threatening language, helping identify models that maintain civil discourse even when prompted with problematic content.\n\nIn addition, the [ETHICS benchmark assesses alignment with human moral principles](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385009398_Is_ETHICS_about_ethics_Evaluating_the_ETHICS_benchmark) across scenarios involving justice, virtue, deontology, and utilitarianism, with [Center for AI Safety](https://www.safe.ai/) research showing that models trained solely on predictive accuracy often develop concerning ethical blind spots that specialized evaluation helps detect.\n\nRed-teaming methodologies adapted from cybersecurity, pioneered by organizations like [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/challenges-in-red-teaming-ai-systems), provide systematic stress-testing through professional penetration testers who probe for vulnerabilities using sophisticated attack vectors, creating continuous feedback loops for building more robust safety systems.\n\nImplementing comprehensive safety monitoring requires multidimensional approaches combining automated metrics with human evaluation in frameworks that dynamically evolve alongside models, ensuring safety mechanisms remain effective against emerging threats while maintaining model utility for legitimate applications.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #6: Multimodal Evaluation Benchmarks\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMultimodal evaluation benchmarks assess language models\' ability to process and reason across different types of content simultaneously. [MMBench](https://github.com/open-compass/MMBench), for example, tests visual-language capabilities through diverse tasks requiring image understanding and reasoning. This benchmark challenges models to interpret visual content and respond to complex queries about images.\n\nFor documents, [SEED (Synthetic Evaluation Examples for Document Understanding)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04367) creates controlled test cases for document processing, with metrics focusing on models\' ability to extract and integrate information from text, tables, and images within documents. These benchmarks are vital as multimodal applications continue to grow in importance.\n\nA unique challenge in multimodal evaluation is measuring cross-modal alignment. Benchmarks must determine how well models connect concepts across modalities, like linking textual descriptions to visual features. This requires specialized metrics beyond traditional language evaluation, such as visual grounding accuracy and cross-modal retrieval performance.\n\nTesting for balanced capabilities is another critical consideration. Multimodal benchmarks now include separate evaluations for visual reasoning, audio comprehension, and joint understanding tasks. This approach reveals whether models excel uniformly across modalities or show imbalanced capabilities that need addressing.\n\nResearch from [LAION](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=M3Y74vmsMcY) and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/frontiers-of-multimodal-learning-a-responsible-ai-approach/) has driven progress in [multimodal evaluation strategies](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/multimodal-ai-guide), introducing frameworks that better reflect a human judgment of multimodal understanding. These approaches often combine automated metrics with human evaluation to capture nuances in model performance.\n\nThe technical implementation of multimodal benchmarks requires careful dataset curation to avoid modality bias and ensure diverse representation across difficulty levels. As models grow more sophisticated, benchmarks continue to evolve, introducing more complex reasoning tasks that mirror real-world multimodal challenges.\n\nLLM Benchmark Category #7: Industry-Specific Benchmarks\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nDifferent industries prioritize distinct benchmarking metrics based on their unique requirements and challenges. As LLMs are deployed in high-stakes environments, specialized evaluation frameworks become essential to ensure they meet domain-specific standards and safety requirements.\n\n### Healthcare: Where Accuracy is Life-Critical\n\nHealthcare-specific LLM benchmarks like [MedQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01553) and [MedMCQA](https://medmcqa.github.io/) evaluate models on medical knowledge, clinical reasoning, and diagnostic accuracy. These specialized datasets require LLMs to demonstrate not just factual knowledge but also the ability to apply it in complex clinical scenarios.\n\n[John Snow Labs\' suite of Medical LLMs](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/john-snow-labs-new-suite-of-medical-language-models-advance-industry-benchmarks/) has established new industry benchmarks by focusing on faithful clinical recommendations and diagnostic reasoning. Their evaluation framework measures robustness across diverse patient populations and clinical contexts to prevent potentially harmful recommendations.\n\nFor medical cases, [BenchHealth](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380121480_Large_Language_Models_in_Healthcare_A_Comprehensive_Benchmark) represents another advancement, establishing comprehensive standards for evaluating how well models handle ambiguous medical cases where multiple interpretations are possible – a critical capability for patient safety.\n\n### Finance: Benchmarking for Numerical Precision and Compliance\n\nFinance-specific benchmarks like [FinanceBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PatronusAI/financebench) test numerical reasoning capabilities crucial for financial analysis tasks. These frameworks evaluate if models can accurately calculate metrics like EBITDA and PE ratios while adhering to regulatory standards.\n\n[FinanceBench](https://www.patronus.ai/announcements/patronus-ai-launches-financebench-the-industrys-first-benchmark-for-llm-performance-on-financial-questions) revealed that general-purpose LLMs often struggle with financial calculations, showing only about 57% accuracy in numerical tasks despite strong performance in text-based financial analysis.\n\nDomain-specific FinLLMs demonstrate superior performance in financial sentiment analysis but still face challenges with complex numerical reasoning and regulatory compliance tasks – areas where benchmarks must continue to evolve to support safe deployment in financial contexts.\n\n### Legal: Evaluating Reasoning in Ambiguous Contexts\n\nLegal-specific benchmarks like [LegalBench](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench) and [CaseHOLD](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462757.3466088) assess LLMs on their capacity to interpret statutes, analyze precedents, and construct valid legal arguments. These frameworks prioritize precision, logical reasoning, and the ability to navigate linguistic ambiguity inherent in legal texts.\n\nLegalBench evaluations have demonstrated that while LLMs can effectively parse legal documents, they often struggle with the logical application of legal principles in complex litigation scenarios – highlighting gaps in reasoning capabilities that require targeted improvement.\n\nThese specialized benchmarks assess jurisdictional knowledge variations and evaluate models\' ability to identify legal issues requiring human review, which remains essential for responsible AI deployment in legal contexts where interpretive nuance and procedural expertise are paramount.\n\nElevate Your LLM Evaluation with Galileo\n----------------------------------------\n\nBuilding effective evaluation frameworks requires a deep understanding of domain-specific metrics, robust testing methodologies, and consistent monitoring.

We construct the benchmark using a taxonomy of nine financial task categories, developed in consultation with experts from banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms. The dataset includes 537 expert-authored questions, covering tasks from information retrieval to complex financial modeling, where each question was validated through a rigorous review process to ensure accuracy and relevance. Moreover, we implement an agentic harness that equips LLMs with tools sufficient to produce an accurate response, including as Google Search and EDGAR database access. Overall, Finance Agent Benchmark provides a comprehensive testbed for measuring the progress of LLM-driven finance agents.\nOur evaluation reveals significant limitations in current AI capabilities—even the best-performing model (OpenAI’s o3) achieved only 46.8% accuracy, at an average cost of $3.79 per query.

With daily foreign exchange turnover averaging $7.5 trillion [6], financial operations demand extensive human resources for routine tasks. Entry-level finance professionals sometimes spend up to 40% of their workweek on gathering data rather than analyzing it [21]—time that could be better used for Preprint. Under review.\narXiv:2508.00828v1 [cs.CE] 20 May 2025 Figure 2: Architecture of the Finance Agent Benchmark. The framework features a structured evaluation process with four key steps: (1) Data Creation: experts identify practical and common financial questions requiring access to public financial documents and provide reference answers. (2) Rubric Development: expert-generated data is used to create robust rubrics with expected calculations and reasoning steps for standardized LLM evaluation. (3) Agent Evaluation: questions are processed through LLMs equipped with necessary tools to generate answers. (4) Answer Grading: an LLM-as-judge scoring system using LLM-as-judge applies conjunction rules to determine correctness across multiple criteria.\nstrategic analysis that drives business value. The repetitive and essential nature of these tasks requires significant workforce investment and creates inefficiencies.\nRecent developments in autonomous AI agents offer a promising solution for financial workflows [33, 9]. These systems have shown advancements in their ability to perform complex tasks that involve unstructured data and multi-step reasoning—capabilities essential for financial analysis [1]. By automating routine yet time-consuming tasks, AI agents can greatly reduce human effort.\nHowever, despite this clear potential, there remains a need for robust, domain-specific benchmarks to assess the capabilities of financial agents.\nPrevious benchmarks often fail to address the interactive environments and nuanced reasoning an agent must undergo when completing industry-specific tasks, leaving performance in real-world scenarios uncertain [4]. This deficiency is particularly concerning given that AI models can generate plausible-sounding misinformation and hallucinations [28], which, if relied upon for high-stake, high-impact decisions, could lead to severe negative outcomes.\nFor instance, if an AI model misinterprets a company’s earnings report, incorrectly identifying a consistent earnings beat over four consecutive quarters, it could lead to misguided decision to invest in the company. Without proper evaluation, these systems cannot be trusted for high-stakes financial applications. A dedicated benchmark is essential for tracking the state-of-the-art financial agents and highlighting the remaining deficits in model capabilities in this domain.\nTo fill this gap, we present Finance Agent Benchmark (Figure 2), a novel, standardized framework to rigorously evaluate AI agents on real-world financial analysis tasks. Our benchmark offers: • Realistic queries representing real-world challenges: We collaborated with seven domain experts across the financial services industry (banks, hedge funds, private equity) to identify and categorize common analytical tasks performed with public financial documents, see Table 1.\n• Step-by-step expert annotation for reliable validation: We constructed this comprehensive dataset with questions, corresponding answers and reasoning trajectories (steps to answer) created by the experts. Each question is verifiable through public U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s filings from the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) database, official repository for public company filings, and underwent peer-review by the experts.\n• Multi-dimensional Evaluation Framework: Our benchmark uses an LLM-as-judge approach with rubric-based assessment that evaluates answers against specific components of expert solutions rather than holistically. The framework incorporates multiple accuracy verification checks and a 2 contradiction detection mechanism to identify factual inconsistencies between generated and expert answers.\n• Model-Agnostic Evaluation Harness for Benchmark Baseline: We developed an agentic evalua-tion framework (Figure 3) equipped with multiple tools, including Google Search and EDGAR Research Filing Search, enabling standard benchmarking and performance assessment across different LLMs. We established performance baselines using our evaluation harness, providing a foundation for future research in finance-focused AI agents.\nOur analysis in Figure 1 indicates that substantial progress is still needed—the best-performing baseline model, o3, achieved only 46.8% accuracy. This highlights the benchmark’s value in testing the ability of models to perform time-intensive tasks expected of entry level finance analysts. Notably, no model surpassed 50% accuracy, underscoring the advancements required before these systems can be deployed autonomously and reliably in the financial sector.\nNevertheless, these models demonstrate notable efficiency advantages: even the most expensive model (o3) averages just 3.1 minutes per task and costs $3.78, compared to human experts requiring 16.8 minutes and costing $25.66 1 for equivalent analyses. This efficiency-to-performance ratio points to the promising potential of these models in supporting human analysts, even as work continues toward improving their accuracy for more autonomous applications.\n2 Finance Agent Benchmark: High-quality Financial Benchmark 2.1 Dataset Creation Process Expert Consultation and Taxonomy Development. We collaborated with financial industry experts from banks, hedge funds, and startups to identify common analytical tasks and develop a compre-hensive taxonomy of finance analysis questions. Figure 2 shows the overall development process of the benchmark. The experts had at least 2-3 years of working experience at bulge bracket firms such as Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. The resulting taxonomy categorizes tasks based on complexity and frequency in real investment banking contexts, ranging from basic retrieval to complex market analysis. See dataset taxonomy in Table 1.\nQuestion Generation and Quality Control. The experts then crafted 537 questions across nine task categories, with instructions to create queries requiring multiple financial documents. Each entry includes the question, ground-truth answer, necessary source documents, and a step-by-step solution approach. Questions were designed to be answerable without additional information beyond what is available on the open internet or in public filings. The experts focused their question generation on documents published no earlier than 2024 (after most training cutoffs).\nRigorous Validation Process. Each question underwent peer review by a different expert to verify calculations and content validity. Questions containing errors were either corrected or removed.\nThe authors of this paper conducted a final review to standardize formatting and ensure consistency throughout the benchmark. This multi-stage validation process ensured that our dataset represents real-world financial analysis challenges.\n2.2 Evaluation Methodology The LLM-as-judge methodology is becoming more widespread, as the complexity of evaluation scales with the complexity of tasks studied [13]. Our dataset employs a refined LLM-as-judge approach designed to maximize accuracy by systematically reducing both false positives and false negatives.\nWe particularly focus on false negatives, which tend to occur more frequently when using language models as evaluators [19].\nRubric-Based Evaluation.\nRather than evaluating answers holistically, we separate assessment into distinct rubrics that align with specific key points from expert answers [2]. For example, if an expert’s answer contains three main points, we check for the presence of each point in the generated answer separately. For straightforward responses (e.g., numerical values like “$5,234,183“), 1These calculations only account for time spent directly answering the question, and exclude the time to create the question, review the answer, etc.\n3 Task Name Question Example Difficulty Count Quantitative Retrieval What was the quarterly revenue of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) for the quarter ended December 31, 2024?\nEasy 102 (19%) Qualitative Retrieval Describe the product offerings and business model of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)?\nEasy 97 (18%) Numerical Reasoning What is % of revenue derived from AWS in each year and the 3 year CAGR from 2021-2024 of Amazon?\nEasy 83 (15%) Complex Retrieval Please briefly summarize the most recent capital raise conducted by Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX).\nMedium 29 (6%) Adjustments What is Lemonade Insurance’s Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024?\nMedium 43 (8%) Beat or Miss How did Lam Research’s revenue compare to manage-ment projections (at midpoint) on a quarterly basis in 2024?

This structured approach enhances evaluation reliability by ensuring thorough coverage of all critical aspects while maintaining high standards of factual accuracy and completeness.\nRubric Generation Process.\nWe used GPT-4o to automatically extract initial rubrics from the experts’ questions and answers (see Appendix C.1 for the exact prompts used). Each question, answer, and its associated rubrics were then manually reviewed by the authors of this paper to verify they had accurately captured the key points of the answer written by the expert.\nContradiction Detection.\nTo ensure factual accuracy, we implement a dedicated “contradiction rubric” that examines whether any part of the generated answer conflicts with the expert’s answer.\nThis approach leverages the observation that identifying contradictions between texts is typically more reliable than confirming complete agreement on all points [26]. An example is provided in Appendix A.2.\nDataset Split.\nWe divided the dataset into three parts: a public validation set (50 samples under the CC BY 4.0 License, available in the project’s repository), a private validation set (150 samples available to researchers upon request), and a test set (337 samples kept fully private to prevent future overfitting and contamination issues [30]). All metrics reported in this paper were calculated on the complete 537 samples. Further details about the split are available in Appendix B.\n3 Financial Agent Harness We created an agentic harness2 for the LLMs shown in Figure 3 to produce the generations being evaluated. We built this infrastructure based on commonly used frameworks like ReAct [32] [12] [27], and informed by recent agentic evaluation benchmarks such as PaperBench [24] and SWE-Lancer [15]. This harness allows the models to be evaluated in an environment where they had access to a set of tools that is sufficient to produce an accurate response.\n2https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15428823 4 Figure 3: Financial Agent Harness architecture showing the interaction flow between LLM compo-nents, specialized tools, and information sources.\n3.1 Tools Overview The harness employs a variety of specialized tools to access and process financial information. Each tool is designed to perform a specific function: • GoogleSearch: A tool to access general web search.\n• EdgarSearch: A tool to access the EDGAR database, containing public SEC filings3.\n• ParseHTML: A tool that extracts and saves content from HTML web pages in a key-value store database.\n• RetrieveInformation: A tool to retrieve stored document content from the key-value database and send the retrieved content to the model.\nThe ParseHTML and the RetrieveInformation tools collectively allow the model to manage its own context window. The human experts did not make use of any additional tools when writing and answering their questions. More information about each tool is available in Appendix C.2.\n3.2 Environment Feedback Environment feedback is a critical aspect of agent environments [33]. As described in Figure 3, after any tool call, the model receives feedback on whether the call succeeded or failed, and the result of the call (on success).\nIn our case, most errors occurred when calling the underlying API for each tool. We categorize into two types: retryable and agent errors.\n• Retryable: These primarily include rate limit errors from APIs. We do not treat them as agent errors; instead, we automatically retry the request using exponential backoff.\n• Agent errors: These include issues such as exceeding token limits or providing incorrect arguments to tools. We consider these as model-generated errors and return them as tool responses.\nFurther details on our error-handling approach can be found in Appendix C.3.\nThese tools work together to enable the agent to research financial information effectively while gracefully handling various error conditions. We have released the full evaluation harness on our GitHub.\n3https://www.sec.gov/search-filings 5 Model Acc. (Class-Balanced) ↑ Acc.

Best values in bold green, worst in bold red.\n4 Experiments and Results 4.1 Experiments Setup Setup and Hyperparameters. All models were evaluated under consistent conditions to ensure a fair comparison: • Prompting: All models were prompted identically using the instruction provided in Appendix C.1.\nNo system prompt was used, as not all providers or models support this feature.\n• Temperature: The temperature was set to 0 for all models that supported this parameter to ensure better reproducibility of results [18]. For models without configurable temperature, the default temperature (typically 1) was used.\n• Token Limit: The maximum token limit was set sufficiently high (16,384 tokens by default) to avoid truncation before response completion. In practice, most responses did not approach this limit.\n• Compute Environment: All experiments were lightweight in terms of memory and compute, as they primarily involved API calls. They were conducted on an AWS t2.2xlarge EC2 instance.\nEvaluation Metrics. We report two types of accuracy: • Class-Balanced accuracy: An average accuracy was computed for each category of question. The per-category scores were averaged, with equal weighting given to each.\n• Naive accuracy: The percentage of questions the model got right, regardless of category.\n4.2 Results We find the class-balanced accuracy to be more representative of the model’s general agentic financial capabilities. This is because some retrieval categories are overrepresented and often require signifi-cantly fewer tool calls or agentic behavior. If not otherwise specified, the figures below show results on the Class-Balanced Accuracy.\n6 0 1 2 3 0 5 10 15 20 25 Average Number Across Queries 11.1 4.5 24.8 1.7 1.6 0.8 9.0 0.3 12.1 4.3 16.0 3.5 Turns Tool Calls Errors (a) Global tool usage statistics.\n20 40 60 Google Web Search EDGAR Search Retrieve Information Parse HTML Page Claude 3.7 Sonnet Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview GPT 4o Mini Llama 4 Maverick (b) Tool usage distribution between the 4 tools, in percentage.\nFigure 4: Overall tool use analysis. The best models not only better understand how to use the tools, they also tend to search deeper and be more persistent before settling on an answer. GPT 4o Mini is an outlier in this behavior, with a high number of unsuccessful tool calls.\nFigure 1 shows the subset of models that define the accuracy-cost Pareto curve (see the complete results in Figure 7). The models that define the Pareto curve and achieve over 20% accuracy are o3, o4-mini, and GPT 4.1 mini. There is also a very clear logarithmic trend of cost versus accuracy, although some noticeable outliers include OpenAI’s o3-mini and Cohere Command A, which fall significantly below the curve.\n4.2.1 Agent Tool Calling Analysis Figure 4 presents an overview of tool usage behavior across four representative models, chosen due to their markedly different strategies. A more exhaustive version covering all models is provided in the Appendix in Figure 11. Subfigure 4a shows global statistics, including the number of conversational turns and tool calls, as well as error rates. The number of turns taken to reach an answer ranges from 3.5 (LLaMA 4 Maverick) to 12.1 (Claude 3.7 Sonnet), while tool calls vary from 1.7 (LLaMA 4 Maverick) to an unusually high 24.8 (GPT-4o Mini).\nInsight 1: More exploratory models tend to perform better. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which ranks among the top performers, makes significantly more tool calls than either LLaMA 4 or Gemini, suggesting that more extensive exploration contributes to improved results. This behavior pattern also holds for the top performing model, o3 (see Figure 11).\nInsight 2: High tool usage without precision leads to failure. GPT-4o Mini stands out as an outlier, issuing a large number of tool calls, often in batches. However, this model suffers from the highest error rate by far, indicating poor tool utilization. It frequently fails by calling the same tool repeatedly (e.g., EDGAR Search) despite persistent errors, without adjusting its strategy.\nInsight 3: Balanced tool usage correlates with performance. In Subfigure 4b, which breaks down tool use across tools, higher-performing models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview demonstrate balanced use across retrieval, search, and parsing operations. This indicates a nuanced understanding of when and how to apply specific tools.\nInsight 4: Tool misuse accounts for poor performance in some models. LLaMA 4 Maverick, despite making fewer tool calls overall, shows disproportionate use of retrieval operations. In practice, this results in the model hallucinating documents and attempting to extract information from them, even when no such documents exist—highlighting a core misunderstanding of the tool interface.\n4.2.2 Case Study Examples To highlight behavioral differences in tool usage, Figure 5 presents agent trajectories for the task: Due to its business combinations, what is RTX Corp’s (NYSE: RTX) projected future contractual obligation consumption for 2025 - 2029?

On each subplot, the numbers above the row are the turn index, and the numbers below are the number of tokens used for the turn (in thousands).\nAs noted in Section 4.2.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet explores tools extensively and efficiently. It follows a highly iterative strategy, repeatedly engaging with multiple tools even after successful calls. This verification approach aligns with its high tool call count and low error rate. Due to its speed, Claude 3.7 makes significantly more tool calls than o1 within the same 200-second timeframe, yet o1 fails to get the correct answer despite using the right tool sequence.\nGemini 2.5 Pro Preview displays the most streamlined trajectory, performing a minimal yet sufficient sequence to produce the correct result. While effective here, this tendency to use fewer tools reduces accuracy across the dataset.\nLLaMA 4 Maverick misunderstands the purpose of the tools, calling EDGAR and Google searches but providing an answer without properly parsing and retrieving information from the results.\n5 Related Work General Autonomous-Agent Evaluation. LLMs have evolved from text predictors to autonomous agents [5, 31] capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks across domains. Modern agent frameworks enhance LLMs with access to external tools—such as calculators, search engines, and APIs—and allow them to reason, act, and decide when to stop autonomously [32, 16, 22]. This shift has spurred a wave of general-purpose agent benchmarks.\nAgentBench [12] evaluates LLM agents in interactive simulations spanning reasoning, web navigation, and games. GTA (General Tool Agents) [27] introduces real-user tool-augmented tasks covering web search, summarization, and booking. For coding tasks, SWE-Lancer [15] offers 1,488 real-world freelance problems sourced from Upwork. Web-based benchmarks such as GAIA [14] and WebVoyager [8] evaluate agentic browsing and user emulation across diverse sites.\n8 Despite their diversity, these benchmarks rarely include fresh, time-sensitive questions. As a result, it’s often unclear whether a model retrieved information during execution or memorized it during pretraining. Moreover, there is a lack of benchmarks targeting in-depth financial analysis—a crit-ical domain where real-time, tool-augmented reasoning is essential. Our proposed FinanceAgent Benchmark addresses this gap with live EDGAR access, expert-written contemporary tasks, and strict grounding in evidence.\nFinance-based NLP & QA Datasets. Since their emergence into mainstream awareness, LLMs have been extensively investigated for their potential applications in financial services and analysis [17], to the point of training models for this sole purpose [29]. Earlier work on finance QA centered on static datasets such as FinQA [3] and TAT-QA [34], which require numerical and hybrid reasoning over financial reports. These benchmarks contributed to specialized modeling approaches but did not support agentic planning or tool use.\nRecent efforts have moved toward agent-style frameworks. [35] combines expert and critic LLMs for answer verification over structured filings, improving factual accuracy via multi-agent collaboration.\nFailSafeQA [20] evaluates robustness in finance QA with realistic, noisy queries based on EDGAR filings, but still assumes a static input and lacks autonomous planning. SWE-Lancer [15] is also relevant as a large-scale task benchmark, though it focuses on software engineering rather than finance.\nFinAgent [36] and MarS [10] explores the ability of an LLM-based agent to make decisions on the stock market based on multimodal observations: however, both focus on numerical data analysis rather than large documents.\nIn contrast, our FinanceAgent Benchmark evaluates autonomous agents on real-world financial workflows. It features 537 expert-authored, validated questions across nine categories, emphasiz-ing multi-step reasoning, real-time retrieval from live SEC filings, and evidence-backed answers.\nAgents are equipped with tools like EDGAR search, calculators, and web access, making this the first benchmark to comprehensively test finance-specific agent capabilities in realistic, high-stakes environments.\n6 Conclusion Finance Agent Benchmark demonstrates significant limitations in current AI financial analysis capabilities. The best-performing model achieved only 46.8% accuracy, highlighting a substantial gap between AI and human expert performance. The benchmark proved challenging across all tested systems, with performance varying dramatically between models (from below 3% to 46.8%).\nDespite these limitations, all models completed tasks significantly faster than human experts, indicat-ing potential productivity benefits even with current technological constraints. Performance followed a clear logarithmic cost-accuracy relationship, with specific models (o3, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, o4 Mini) defining the efficiency frontier. The stark performance differences across task types—with models handling simple retrieval better than complex financial modeling or market analysis—suggests that while AI agents show promise for automating routine financial tasks, considerable advancement is needed before these systems can reliably operate autonomously in high-stakes financial environments.\nThis benchmark provides a critical measure for tracking progress as foundation models continue to evolve toward meeting real-world financial analysis requirements. For future work, we recommend deeper investigation into model performance on structured tabular data or using more complex agents.\nRefer to detailed discussion in Appendix D.\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding Thanks to the following people for their support: Alfston Thomas, Andrew Schettino, Kathy Ye, Kyle Jung, Matthew Friday, Michael Xia, and Nicholas Crawley-Brown.\nThis report was funded by Vals AI, a startup dedicated to evaluating Large Language Models References [1] Siyu An, Qin Li, Junru Lu, Di Yin, and Xing Sun.

It verifies factual content such as numerical figures (accepting rounded values), names, dates, and relationships between facts. Each check should represent a complete piece of information rather than fragmenting related facts into separate checks. The format, writing style, and length of the answer do not affect this check.\nGuidelines: 1. Break down complex answers into multiple simple checks only when the answer contains distinct, separable components.\n2. Create checks that are specific, measurable, and objective.\n3. Ensure each criteria is clear, precise, and unambiguous. Do not write full sentences for the criteria if not necessary. It can just be figures or phrases.\nUser Prompt Convert this answer into a list of specific evaluation checks.\nBreak down complex requirements into multiple simple checks where appropriate.\nReturn the result as a JSON array of objects with ’operator’ and ’criteria’ fields.\nImportant: The question and reasoning are provided ONLY for context to help you understand the answer.\nYour checks must ONLY evaluate the answer itself - not the question or reasoning.\nThe checks will be applied exclusively to the answer text.\nCreate meaningful checks that capture substantive elements of the answer. Each check should: - Evaluate a significant aspect of the answer - Be clearly defined and testable - Make sense as a standalone evaluation criterion Very important: - Do not split sentences or phrases into multiple checks if they are related to the same underlying concept.\n- Some answers might be a bit verbose and contain more information than originally asked in the question. Do not make more checks than what is asked in the question. For example, if a question asks about a specific number, and the answer contains the number but also the calculation, do not make two checks: one for the number and one for the calculation. Make only one check for the number.\n- Particularly make sure that the logical connections are kept within the same check and not split into multiple checks.\nData to evaluate: Question: {question} Reasoning: {reasoning} Answer: {answer} A.2 Evaluation Example To illustrate our approach, consider the following question from our dataset: 13 “How has Carvana’s (NYSE: CVNA) gross profit per unit changed from 2019-2024?” The expert’s answer contains several key facts: “CVNA has increased its gross profit per unit from $2,852 in 2019 to $7,196 in 2024 representing a 20.3% CAGR. It has driven this metric through improved operating and technology efficiencies as well as introducing new products such as origination fees from financing.” Instead of evaluating this answer as a whole, we decompose it into five distinct checks: 1. CVNA gross profit per unit in 2019 was $2,852 2. CVNA gross profit per unit in 2024 was $7,196 3. CVNA gross profit per unit increased at a 20.3% CAGR from 2019 to 2024 4. Increase driven by improved operating and technology efficiencies 5. Increase driven by new products such as origination fees from financing Each point is evaluated separately using a dedicated evaluation check. Additionally, we employ a contradiction check, against the entire expert answer to ensure the generated response doesn’t contain any conflicting information.\nB Dataset Access B.1 Accessibility and Reproducibility The dataset and code are released under permissive open-source licenses: CC BY 4.0 for the dataset and MIT License for the code.

Today is {current_date}. You are given a question and you need to answer it using the tools provided. You may not interact with the user.\nWhen you have the answer, you should respond with ’FINAL ANSWER:’ followed by your answer.\nAt the end of your answer, you should provide your sources in a dictionary with the following format: { "sources": [ { "url": "https://example.com", "name": "Name of the source" }, ...\n] } Question: {question} C.2 Tool Use C.2.1 Google Web Search A tool that leverages SerpAPI [23] to perform web searches.\nInput Arguments: • search_query (string, required): The query to search for information Implementation Details: • Returns up to 10 results by default • Uses SerpAPI to access Google Search results • Results include title, link, and snippet information C.2.2 EDGAR Search A tool for searching the SEC’s EDGAR database using the SEC API.\nInput Arguments: • query (string, required): Keywords or phrases to search (e.g., "substantial doubt" OR "material weakness") • form_types (array, required): SEC form types to limit search to (e.g., ["8-K", "10-Q"]) • ciks (array, required): Company CIK numbers to filter results • start_date (string, required): Start date in yyyy-mm-dd format • end_date (string, required): End date in yyyy-mm-dd format • page (string, required): Pagination parameter • top_n_results (integer, required): Number of top results to return Implementation Details: • Returns filing metadata, not the full filing text • Optimized for financial document discovery 16 C.2.3 Parse HTML Page A tool that extracts and saves content from web pages.\nInput Arguments: • url (string, required): The URL of the HTML page to parse • key (string, required): The key to use when saving the result in the data structure Implementation Details: • Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content • Extracts clean text by removing scripts, styles, and formatting • Saves content to a key-value store store later retrieval C.2.4 Retrieve Information A tool that retrieves stored document content and processes it through the LLM.\nInput Arguments: • prompt (string, required): The prompt containing placeholder(s) in format {{key_name}} • input_character_ranges (object, optional): Dictionary mapping keys to character ranges [start, end] Implementation Details: • Replaces {{key_name}} placeholders with actual document content • Allows extracting specific portions of documents using character ranges • Makes a call to the same LLM that’s leading the agent to process the information C.3 Error Handling C.3.1 Rate Limit Errors • Implements exponential backoff with randomized jitter for 429 errors • Automatically retries API calls when rate limits are encountered • Maximum of 8 retry attempts with increasing delays C.3.2 Token Limit Errors • During retrieval: Errors from documents that are too large are returned to the agent, which can retry by sending partial document chunks • During conversation: If the conversation exceeds the token limit, older messages are removed until the entire exchange fits within the allowed limits. We chose not to implement a more sophisticated long-short term memory mechanism, as the model rarely exhausted its context window during typical conversations. In most instances where this did occur, it was due to the model repeatedly attempting—unsuccessfully—to use the same tool, a behavior we categorize as a model error mode.\nC.3.3 Argument Formatting Errors • Input validation errors are caught and returned to the agent • Detailed error messages help the agent understand and correct formatting issues • Handles special cases like JSON string parsing for arrays 17 D Limitations D.1 Dataset Our current dataset emphasizes questions that can be answered with relatively short passages or that focus on the final output of a more complex reasoning process. During development, domain experts highlighted that a significant portion of their workflows involves interacting with structured tabular data, such as spreadsheets or CSV files. While we included a few examples of such queries, future work could more deeply investigate model performance in synthesizing or reasoning over entire tabular documents and financial datasets. Prior research has begun exploring this direction, demonstrating the challenges and opportunities of reasoning over structured financial data [25, 11].\nMoreover, although we asked models to provide citations or sources for their answers, we did not evaluate the accuracy or reliability of these sources. This is an important avenue for future work, especially in high-stakes domains. Recent work on source attribution and citation accuracy in language models could guide such evaluation [7].\nD.2 Agentic Harness The agentic harness used in our experiments follows a relatively simple architecture inspired by the ReAct framework, enabling models to interleave reasoning and action [32]. Our setup is comparable in spirit to benchmarks such as PaperBench [24] and SWE-Lancer [15]. While sufficient to evaluate general capabilities, it is not representative of the full complexity of commercial retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems or proprietary agentic tools developed by industry leaders such as OpenAI, Google, or xAI.\nFuture research should explore how these more advanced systems—many of which integrate propri-etary retrieval mechanisms, structured data backends, or user feedback loops—perform on similar document understanding tasks. Additionally, our models only had access to publicly available SEC filings and were not integrated with private knowledge bases or advanced retrieval systems. Enabling access to broader and deeper data sources, including internal contracts and proprietary databases, could significantly impact performance in real-world use cases.\nE Additional Analysis E.1 General Analysis Figure 8 the average distribution of tool usage across the four available tools, for each model. In general, tool usage varied significantly by model. For example, mistral barely used the Edgar Search tool, whereas other models like LLaMA Maverick used it significantly. Tool usage also varied significantly even between models from the same generation or provider - GPT 4.1 Nano uses significantly more RetrieveInformation calls than GPT 4.1.\nFor the rest of the detailed metrics, we present the metrics described above categorized by question type. The results are displayed using two model subsets: • Reasoning Models: These are displayed separately due to their increasing prominence in recent research.\n• Full Range Subset: This subset includes six models spanning the performance spectrum, from the highest-performing to one of the lowest-performing, with several intermediate performers included.\nE.1.1 Time and Cost Analysis The overall takeaway from Figure 9 and Figure 10 is that all models are significantly more time effective than human experts, ranging from two times faster to more than ten times faster.\n18 0.000 0.500 1.000 1.500 2.000 2.500 3.000 3.500 4.000 0 10 20 30 40 50 Cost per Question (USD) Accuracy (%) o3 Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) Claude 3.7 Sonnet o4 Mini Grok 3 Mini Fast Beta High Reasoning Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview GPT 4.1 Grok 3 Beta o1 GPT 4.1 mini GPT 4o (2024-08-06) Grok 3 Mini Fast Beta Low Reasoning Gemini 2.0 Flash (001) Claude 3.5 Haiku Latest o3 Mini GPT 4o Mini Mistral Small 3.1 (03/2025) Llama 4 Scout Command A Llama 4 Maverick Llama 3.3 Instruct Turbo (70B) GPT 4.1 nano Figure 7: Cost-Accuracy pareto curve results on Finance Agent Benchmark.\no3 Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) Claude 3.7 Sonnet o4 Mini Grok 3 Mini Fast Beta High Reasoning Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview GPT 4.1 Grok 3 Beta o1 GPT 4.1 mini GPT 4o (2024-08-06) Grok 3 Mini Fast Beta Low Reasoning Gemini 2.0 Flash (001) Claude 3.5 Haiku Latest o3 Mini GPT 4o Mini Mistral Small 3.1 (03/2025) Llama 4 Scout Command A Llama 4 Maverick Llama 3.3 Instruct Turbo (70B) GPT 4.1 nano 0 50 100 n=12.5 n=10.8 n=11.1 n=9.2 n=9.3 n=4.5 n=6.4 n=6.7 n=3.8 n=9.1 n=7.3 n=6.1 n=5.4 n=3.9 n=2.9 n=25.0 n=7.2 n=1.7 n=4.8 n=1.7 n=1.1 n=6.7 Tool Usage (%) Google Web Search EDGAR Search Retrieve Information Parse HTML Page Figure 8: Tool Usage Statistics E.2 Tool Call Analysis by Question Type: Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 11 E.3 Time Analysis by Question Type: Figure 14 and Figure 15 E.4 Cost Analysis by Question Type: Figure ?? and Figure 17 19 Human Expert o3 Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) Claude 3.7 Sonnet o4 Mini Grok 3 Mini Fast Beta High Reasoning Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview GPT 4.1 Grok 3 Beta o1 GPT 4.1 mini GPT 4o (2024-08-06) Grok 3 Mini Fast Beta Low Reasoning Gemini 2.0 Flash (001) Claude 3.5 Haiku Latest o3 Mini GPT 4o Mini Mistral Small 3.1 (03/2025) Llama 4 Scout Command A Llama 4 Maverick Llama 3.3 Instruct Turbo (70B) GPT 4.1 nano 0 5 10 15 20 1010.5s (16.8m) 186.5s (3.1m) 151.3s (2.5m) 121.0s (2.0m) 164.4s (2.7m) 253.0s (4.2m) 72.5s (1.2m) 61.3s (1.0m) 60.5s (1.0m) 426.5s (7.1m) 51.6s (0.9m) 40.9s (0.7m) 80.5s (1.3m) 23.6s (0.4m) 46.8s (0.8m) 146.1s (2.4m) 93.4s (1.6m) 39.1s (0.7m) 13.8s (0.2m) 94.9s (1.6m) 11.8s (0.2m) 3.3s (0.1m) 65.5s (1.1m) Time per Question Figure 9: Overall Time Analysis Compared to Expert Human Expert o3 Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) Claude 3.7 Sonnet o4 Mini Grok 3 Mini Fast Beta High Reasoning Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview GPT 4.1 Grok 3 Beta o1 GPT 4.1 mini GPT 4o (2024-08-06) Grok 3 Mini Fast Beta Low Reasoning Gemini 2.0 Flash (001) Claude 3.5 Haiku Latest o3 Mini GPT 4o Mini Mistral Small 3.1 (03/2025) Llama 4 Scout Command A Llama 4 Maverick Llama 3.3 Instruct Turbo (70B) GPT 4.1 nano 0 5 10 15 20 25 $25.66 $3.79 $1.02 $0.99 $0.29 $0.13 $0.20 $0.23 $0.43 $1.44 $0.07 $0.26 $0.07 $0.01 $0.07 $0.05 $0.04 $0.01 $0.00 $0.56 $0.00 $0.00 $0.00 Cost per Question (USD) Figure 10: Overall Cost Analysis Compared to Expert (avg $91.4 /h) 20 o3 Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) Claude 3.7 Sonnet o4 Mini Grok 3 Mini Fast Beta High Reasoning Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview GPT 4.1 Grok 3 Beta o1 GPT 4.1 mini GPT 4o (2024-08-06) Grok 3 Mini Fast Beta Low Reasoning Gemini 2.0 Flash (001) Claude 3.5 Haiku Latest o3 Mini GPT 4o Mini Mistral Small 3.1 (03/2025) Llama 4 Scout Command A Llama 4 Maverick Llama 3.3 Instruct Turbo (70B) GPT 4.1 nano 0 10 20 13.5 11.8 12.1 10.2 11.1 4.3 5.4 8.0 4.8 9.3 5.6 7.6 5.3 4.9 3.9 16.0 6.6 5.9 10.1 3.5 2.1 7.3 12.5 10.8 11.1 9.2 9.3 4.5 6.4 6.7 3.8 9.1 7.3 6.1 5.4 3.9 2.9 24.8 7.0 1.7 4.8 1.7 1.1 6.7 2.3 1.4 1.6 1.0 1.4 0.8 1.1 0.9 0.9 1.9 1.7 1.0 0.6 0.7 0.5 9.0 2.6 0.2 0.1 0.3 0.2 4.8 Values Avg # of Turns to Answer Avg # of Tool Calls Avg # of Errors during Tool Calls Figure 11: Tool Usage Statistics on All Models 21 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 50 100 n=8 n=9 n=6 n=7 n=4 n=3 n=5 n=2 Tool Usage (%) Adjustments 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 n=17 n=13 n=13 n=11 n=4 n=2 n=7 n=4 Beat or Miss 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 n=15 n=12 n=9 n=10 n=4 n=5 n=6 n=3 Complex Retrieval 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 50 100 n=9 n=7 n=6 n=7 n=2 n=2 n=4 n=1 Tool Usage (%) Financial Modeling Projections 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 n=17 n=14 n=15 n=13 n=7 n=4 n=7 n=2 Market Analysis 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 n=10 n=9 n=7 n=9 n=4 n=3 n=6 n=3 Numerical Reasoning o3 (0) Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) (1) o4 Mini (2) Grok 3 Mini High Reasoning (3) Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (4) o1 (5) Grok 3 Mini Low Reasoning (6) o3 Mini (7) 0 50 100 n=8 n=8 n=6 n=5 n=3 n=2 n=3 n=2 Tool Usage (%) Simple retrieval -

These benchmarks consist of sample data, a set of questions or tasks to test LLMs on specific skills, metrics for evaluating performance and a scoring mechanism.\n\nModels are benchmarked based on their capabilities, such as coding, common sense and reasoning. Other capabilities encompass [natural language processing](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing), including machine translation, question answering and [text summarization](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/text-summarization).\n\nLLM benchmarks play a crucial role in developing and enhancing models. Benchmarks showcase the progress of an LLM as it learns, with quantitative measures that highlight where the model excels and its areas for improvement.\n\nThis in turn guides the [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning) process, which helps LLM researchers and developers advance the field. LLM benchmarks also provide an objective comparison of different models, helping inform software developers and organizations as they choose which models better suit their needs.\n\n## How LLM benchmarks work\n\nLLM benchmarks operate in a straightforward manner. They supply a task that an LLM must accomplish, evaluate model performance according to a certain metric and produce a score based on that metric. Here’s how each step works in detail:\n\n### Setting up\n\nLLM benchmarks already have sample data prepared—coding challenges, large documents, math problems, real-world conversations, science questions. A range of tasks are also at the ready, including commonsense reasoning, problem-solving, question answering, summary generation and translation. These are all given to the model at the outset of testing.\n\n### Testing\n\nWhen running the benchmark, it’s introduced to a model in one of three approaches:\n\n- [Few-shot](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/few-shot-learning): Before prompting an LLM to perform a task, it’s supplied with a small number of examples showing how to fulfill that task. This demonstrates a model’s ability to learn given scarce data.\n- [Zero-shot](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/zero-shot-learning): An LLM is prompted to complete a task without having seen any examples beforehand. This unveils a model’s ability to comprehend new concepts and adapt to novel scenarios.\n- Fine-tuned: A model is trained on a dataset akin to what the benchmark uses. The goal is to boost the LLM’s command of the task associated with the benchmark and optimize its performance in that specific task.\n\n### Scoring\n\nOnce tests are done, an LLM benchmark computes how close a model’s output resembles the expected solution or standard answer, then generates a score between 0 and 100.\n\n![3D design of balls rolling on a track](/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/pm/ul/g/5a/6e/trailv2_1200x1200.component.think-ad-xl.ts=1746554193743.jpeg/content/experience-fragments/adobe-cms/us/en/site-v2/think-hub/article/_8_column_general_ad/blueprint---think-ad---xf---do-not-modify/artificialintelligence-article-newsletter/_jcr_content/root/think_ad_copy/image)\n\n### The latest AI News + Insights\n\nDiscover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.\n\n[Subscribe today](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=news-urx-52954)\n\n## Key metrics for benchmarking LLMs\n\nBenchmarks apply different metrics to evaluate the performance of LLMs. Here are some common ones:\n\n- **Accuracy or precision** calculates the percentage of correct predictions.\n- **Recall**, also called the sensitivity rate, quantifies the number of true positives—the actual correct predictions.\n- The **F1 score** blends both accuracy and recall into one metric. It considers the two measures to be of equal weight to balance out any false positives or false negatives. F1 scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 signifying excellent recall and precision.\n- **Exact match** is the proportion of predictions an LLM matches exactly and is a valuable criteria for translation and question answering.\n- **Perplexity** measures how good a model is at prediction. The lower an LLM’s perplexity score, the better it is at comprehending a task.\n- **Bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU)** evaluates machine translation by computing the matching n-grams (a sequence of n-adjacent text symbols) between an LLM’s predicted translation and a human-produced translation.\n- **Recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE)** evaluates text summarization and has several types. ROUGE-N, for instance, does similar calculations as BLEU for summaries, while ROUGE-L computes the longest common subsequence between the predicted summary and the human-produced summary.\n\nOne or more of these quantitative metrics are usually combined for a more comprehensive and robust assessment.\n\nMeanwhile, human evaluation involves qualitative metrics such as coherence, relevance and semantic meaning. Human assessors examining and scoring an LLM can make for a more nuanced assessment, but it can be labor intensive, subjective and time consuming. Therefore, a balance of both quantitative and qualitative metrics is needed.\n\nAI Academy\n\n### Why foundation models are a paradigm shift for AI\n\nLearn about a new class of flexible, reusable AI models that can unlock new revenue, reduce costs and increase productivity, then use our guidebook to dive deeper.\n\n[Go to episode](https://www.ibm.com/think/videos/ai-academy/foundation-models-paradigm-shift)\n\n## Limitations of LLM benchmarks\n\nWhile benchmarks are solid indicators of LLM performance, they can’t predict how well a model will operate in the real world. Here are a few constraints of LLM benchmarks:\n\nBounded scoring\n\n\nOnce a model reaches the highest possible score for a certain benchmark, that benchmark will need to be updated with more difficult tasks to make it a useful measure.\n\nBroad dataset\n\n\nSince LLM benchmarks use sample data derived mostly from a broad range of subjects and a wide array of tasks, they may not be a fitting metric for edge scenarios, specialized areas or specific use cases.\n\nFinite assessments\n\n\nLLM benchmarks can only test a model’s current skills. But as LLMs advance and novel capabilities emerge, new benchmarks will have to be created.\n\nOverfitting\n\n\nIf an LLM is trained on the same dataset as the benchmark, it could lead to [overfitting](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/overfitting), wherein the model might perform well on the test data but not on real-world data. This results in a score that doesn’t reflect an LLM’s actual abilities.\n\n## What are LLM leaderboards?\n\nLLM leaderboards publish a ranking of LLMs based on a variety of benchmarks. Leaderboards provide a way to keep track of the myriad LLMs and compare their performance. LLM leaderboards are especially beneficial in making decisions on which models to use.\n\nEach benchmark typically has its own leaderboard, but independent LLM leaderboards also exist. For instance, Hugging Face has a collection of leaderboards, one of which is an open LLM leaderboard that ranks multiple open-source models based on the ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA and Winogrande benchmarks.\n\n## Common LLM benchmarks\n\nResearchers classify LLM benchmarks according to these two aspects:1\n\n- **Assessment criteria:**\xa0LLM evaluation metrics can either be ground truth or human preferences.\xa0**Ground truth**\xa0refers to information assumed to be true, while\xa0**human preferences**\xa0are choices reflecting real-world usage.\n- **Source of questions:**\xa0Prompts can come from either static or live sources. **Static** prompts contain predefined questions, while **live** prompts are questions made in an interactive environment.\n\nBenchmarks can fall into one or more of these categories. Here’s how some popular benchmarks work:\n\n### AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)\n\nARC measures an LLM’s question answering and reasoning abilities through a series of more than 7,000 grade-school natural science questions. These questions are divided into an easy set and a challenge set. Scoring is simple, with a model getting one point for each correct answer and 1/N points if it provides multiple answers and one of those is correct.2\n\n### Chatbot Arena\n\nChatbot Arena is an open benchmark platform that pits two anonymous chatbots against each other. Users have random real-world conversations with both chatbots in an “arena,” then cast votes on which one they prefer, after which the models’ identities are revealed. This crowdsourced pairwise comparison data is fed into statistical methods that estimate scores and create approximate rankings for various LLMs. Sampling algorithms are also used to pair models.1\n\n### Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K)\n\nGSM8K tests an LLM’s mathematical reasoning skills. It has a corpus of 8,500 grade-school math word problems. Solutions are collected in the form of natural language instead of mathematical expressions. AI verifiers are trained to evaluate model solutions.3\n\n### HellaSwag\n\nHellaSwag is an acronym for “Harder Endings, Longer contexts and Low-shot Activities for Situations With Adversarial Generations.” This benchmark is centered around commonsense reasoning and natural language inference. Models are tasked with completing sentences by choosing from a number of possible endings. These endings include wrong answers created through adversarial filtering, an algorithm that generates realistic yet deceptively incorrect answers. HellaSwag evaluates accuracy for both few-shot and zero-shot categories.4\n\n### HumanEval\n\nHumanEval assesses an LLM’s performance in terms of [code generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/code-generator), specifically functional correctness. Models are given programming problems to solve and are evaluated based on passing the corresponding unit tests. This is similar to human software developers who test if their code is correct based on passing particular unit tests. The HumanEval benchmark uses its own evaluation metric called pass@k, which is the probability that at least one of the k-generated code solutions for a coding problem passes that problem’s unit tests.5\n\n### Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)\n\nMMLU is a benchmark assessing the breadth of an LLM’s knowledge, the depth of its [natural language understanding](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/nlp-vs-nlu-vs-nlg) and its ability to solve problems based on gained knowledge. MMLU’s dataset encompasses more than 15,000 multiple-choice general knowledge questions across 57 subjects. Evaluation occurs solely in few-shot and zero-shot settings. The MMLU benchmark scores a model’s accuracy in each subject then averages those numbers for a final score.6\n\n### Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP)\n\nMBPP, also known as Mostly Basic Python Problems, is another code generation benchmark. It has a corpus of more than 900 coding tasks. Akin to HumanEval, it assesses functional correctness based on passing a set of test cases. Evaluation happens in few-shot and fine-tuned settings. MBPP uses two metrics: the percentage of problems that are solved by any sample from the model and the percentage of samples solving their respective tasks.7\n\n### MT-Bench\n\nThe researchers behind Chatbot Arena also created MT-Bench, which is designed to test how well an LLM can engage in dialogue and follow instructions. Its dataset consists of open-ended multi-turn questions, with 10 questions each in these eight areas: coding, extraction, knowledge I (STEM), knowledge II (humanities and social sciences), math, reasoning, roleplay and writing. MT-Bench uses the GPT-4 LLM to evaluate the responses of other LLMs.8\n\n### SWE-bench\n\nLike HumanEval, SWE-bench tests an LLM’s [code generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-code-generation) skills, with a focus on issue resolution. Models are tasked with fixing a bug or addressing a feature request in a specific code base. The benchmark’s assessment metric is the percentage of resolved task instances.9\n\n### TruthfulQA\n\nLarge language models have a tendency to [hallucinate](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations), resulting in inaccurate outputs. The TruthfulQA benchmark aims to tackle this by measuring an LLM’s ability to generate truthful answers to questions. Its dataset contains more than 800 questions spanning 38 subjects. TruthfulQA combines human evaluation with the GPT-3 LLM fine-tuned on the BLEU and ROUGE metrics to predict human assessments of informativeness and truthfulness.10\n\n### Winogrande\n\nWinogrande evaluates an LLM’s commonsense reasoning capabilities. It builds upon the original Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) benchmark, with a huge dataset of 44,000 crowdsourced problems that also uses adversarial filtering. Scoring is based on accuracy.11\n\n[Ebook\n\nHow to choose the right foundation model\n\nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\n\nRead the ebook](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-52620)\n\n## Resources\n\n[AI models\n\nExplore IBM Granite\n\nDiscover IBM® Granite™, our family of open, performant and trusted AI models, tailored for business and optimized to scale your AI applications.

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ['## Interpreting Benchmark Scores\n\nBenchmark scores are central to evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), providing standardized, quantitative measurement of model performance across a spectrum of linguistic, reasoning, and task-oriented capabilities. With the proliferation of LLMs in domains ranging from research and education to customer service and automation, nuanced interpretation of benchmark results is vital for both scientific advancement and successful deployment. This section offers a detailed guide to understanding what benchmark scores represent, common pitfalls in their interpretation, best practices for model comparison, and implications for real-world use.\n\n### What Benchmark Scores Represent: Core Concepts, Metrics, and Task Alignment\n\nLLM benchmarks are rigorously designed test suites that probe specific language and reasoning competencies, pairing curated datasets with scoring protocols. They serve a critical role in enabling reproducible, cross-model comparisons and in tracking progress within the field. Each benchmark—by virtue of its design—targets a distinct set of skills:\n\n- **General Language Understanding**: Benchmarks such as MMLU and (Super)GLUE assess broad textual comprehension, inference, and analytical abilities across diverse subject areas.\n- **Reasoning and Question Answering**: Datasets like ARC and TruthfulQA challenge models with complex, multi-step reasoning and factuality, emphasizing robustness beyond simple recall.\n- **Math and Coding**: GSM8K and HumanEval are tailored to evaluate operational reasoning and code synthesis, measuring functional correctness and solution generalization.\n- **Conversational and Human-Centric Tasks**: MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena center on multi-turn conversation, preference ranking, and dialogic coherence, incorporating both human and automated evaluations.\n- **Safety and Domain-Specific Tasks**: SafetyBench, LegalBench, and others probe models for robustness against harmful or biased outputs and for competence in critical domains.\n\nMultiple scoring metrics are employed depending on the task:\n- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct answers, a staple in classification and multiple-choice formats (e.g., MMLU).\n- **Precision, Recall, F1**: Standard in information retrieval, highlighting exactness and coverage (e.g., for QA).\n- **BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, MoverScore**: Text similarity metrics, essential for summarization and translation.\n- **Perplexity**: Gauges predictive power by measuring a model’s “surprise” at the reference text; lower perplexity indicates better language modeling.\n- **Pass@k (for code tasks)**: Probability of success among k generated samples.\n- **Human Evaluation and LLM-as-a-Judge**: Qualitative appraisals, particularly pertinent to open-ended or conversational benchmarks.\n\nInterpreting a benchmark score must be contextualized: high performance on a domain-specific task (such as HumanEval for code generation) most reliably signals model readiness for similar operational environments. Aggregate performance may mask critical subdomain strengths or deficiencies, so granular analysis by category is strongly recommended.\n\n### Common Pitfalls and Limitations: Overfitting, Data Contamination, Context Sensitivity\n\nDespite their utility, benchmark scores can be misleading if limitations are overlooked:\n\n**Overfitting and Data Contamination**\n- Many benchmarks have become public and widely used, resulting in inadvertent overlap between benchmark data and model pretraining corpora. This leads to “data contamination,” where models may reproduce answers seen during training rather than demonstrate genuine generalization or reasoning. Empirical studies have identified significant performance drops (15–40%) when models are evaluated on newly generated, decontaminated test sets versus static, widely-leaked public benchmarks.\n- Models can also overfit to benchmark artefacts, learning superficial cues specific to test formats rather than robustly generalizing the underlying skill.\n\n**Prompt and Context Sensitivity**\n- LLM outputs are highly prompt-dependent; small variations in input phrasing, answer order, or question structure can induce large swings in accuracy, even among state-of-the-art models. This fragility is often masked by standard benchmark settings and is well documented across recent meta-benchmarking research.\n- Studies employing parametric rephrasing and compositional variants reveal how easily high-performing models falter when confronted with tasks outside canonical data presentations. This undermines the reliability of benchmark scores as predictors of real-world robustness.\n\n**Benchmark Saturation and Construct Validity**\n- Benchmarks can quickly saturate as top models reach near-perfect scores, diminishing their capacity to differentiate between leading-edge systems. The creation of newer, more complex and dynamic benchmarks is critical for continued meaningful model evaluation.\n- Construct validity—i.e., whether benchmark tasks reliably proxy for the intended cognitive or operational skills—is often unclear, particularly for older benchmarks constructed ad hoc or those misaligned with practical user contexts.\n\n**Statistical Caveats**\n- Aggregate reporting can obscure domain-specific weaknesses; single-score reliance may misrepresent nuanced capabilities. Proper statistical treatment—including confidence intervals and per-category breakdowns—is essential for credible claims.\n\n### Guidance on Comparing Model Results: Methodological Best Practices\n\nRobust comparison and generalization of benchmark results across models and tasks require:\n\n1. **Consistent Evaluation Conditions**: All models should be tested with identical benchmark versions, prompt structures, parameters (e.g., temperature, top-k), and context lengths. Variability in settings can influence outcomes as much as architecture changes.\n2. **Use of Baselines and Reference Points**: Benchmark scores should be interpreted relative to established baselines (random or human performance) and upper/lower bounds, facilitating proper calibration.\n3. **Normalization and Statistical Rigor**: Employ normalized scores and confidence intervals to account for test set differences and sample sizes. Statistical significance testing should accompany marginal claim of superiority.\n4. **Cross-Benchmark Synthesis**: Models ought to be evaluated across a diverse suite of benchmarks (MMLU, TruthfulQA, BigBench, etc.) to gauge comprehensive capability and to hedge against the domain specificity or limitations of any single benchmark.\n5. **Robustness and Contextual Testing**: Model robustness should be assessed with variant prompts, rephrased questions, paraphrased tasks, and adversarial input designs. Performance consistency across these variants is a strong marker of operational reliability.\n6. **Full Documentation and Transparency**: Model and evaluation details—including data sources, training scale, parameter settings, and methodology—must be precisely reported for reproducibility and meaningful comparison.\n\nAttention to these principles supports interpretive accuracy and guards against misleading conclusions driven by benchmark overfitting, data leakage, or methodological inconsistencies.\n\n### Practical Implications for Real-World Use-Cases\n\nBenchmark scores are essential for model triage, selection, and ongoing validation, but they should not be treated as guarantees of real-world performance. Their translation to practical applications depends on multiple additional considerations:\n\n- **Task and Domain Alignment**: Select benchmarks most closely matched to operational requirements. A model excelling on dialogue benchmarks is well-suited for chatbots; models topping code generation tasks are optimal for coding assistants. Disaggregation by domain/task within benchmarks further refines suitability.\n- **Gaps and Risks Identification**: Areas of low or volatile benchmark performance highlight vulnerabilities such as reasoning failures, hallucination risk, or lack of robustness, guiding targeted model improvement and risk mitigation.\n- **Custom and System-Level Testing**: After initial benchmark screening, application-specific test suites—including in-domain datasets, adversarial scenarios, and synthetic user stories—should be developed. Models must be evaluated as fully integrated system components, not in isolation.\n- **Continuous and Iterative Validation**: Regular benchmarking against evolving test sets and real user data is critical, given the phenomenon of “dataset drift”—where user needs and model behaviors change over time, potentially rendering static benchmarks obsolete.\n- **Cost-Benefit Contextualization**: Operational factors such as inference cost, latency, and adaptability intersect with benchmark results in driving deployment decisions. Superior benchmark performance may not offset excessive resource requirements.\n- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Transparent communication regarding the limitations of benchmark-derived assessments, especially regarding contamination risk, prompt dependency, and generalization gaps, facilitates more informed and responsible model deployment.\n\nIn sum, the judicious integration of benchmark scores into a broader, context-rich evaluation framework—augmented by rigorous testing, transparency, and continuous adaptation—remains the cornerstone of reliable LLM capability assessment and successful real-world translation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table: Core Principles for Benchmark Interpretation\n\n| Principle               | Operational Significance                                                                              |\n|------------------------ |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Data Contamination      | Inflates reported scores, undermining generalization; prefer decontaminated, dynamic test sets.       |\n| Overfitting             | May reflect memorization or gaming of benchmark artefacts rather than authentic skill or reasoning.   |\n| Context Sensitivity     | Fragility to prompt/format variations undermines forecasted real-world robustness.                    |\n| Benchmark Saturation    | Once saturated, benchmarks lose discriminatory power; prioritize newer, more complex benchmarks.      |\n| Disaggregated Reporting | Single-score aggregates can mask domain-specific weaknesses; fine-grained breakdowns are preferred.   |\n| Transparency            | Rigorous, detailed reporting supports reproducibility and confidence in comparative assessments.       |\n| System-Level Alignment  | End-to-end application testing must complement model-level benchmarking to assure true readiness.      |\n| Continuous Evaluation   | Evolving benchmarks and datasets are essential for relevance amid changing models and requirements.   |\n\nNo benchmark score should be interpreted in isolation as a definitive measure of model quality.

H5](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#)\n\nHow can you tell if an LLM works well or which one is better than others?\n\nLarge Language Model (LLM) **benchmarks** are standardized tests designed to measure and compare the abilities of different language models. With new LLMs released all the time, these benchmarks let researchers and practitioners see how well each model handles different tasks, from basic language skills to complex reasoning and coding.\n\nThe main reason we use LLM benchmarks is to get a consistent, uniform way to evaluate different models. Since LLMs can be used for a variety of use cases, it’s otherwise hard to compare them fairly. Benchmarks help level the playing field by putting each model through the same set of tests.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll explore the topic of LLM benchmarks and cover:\n\n*   What LLM benchmarks are, how they work, and why we need them.\n*   20 common benchmarks that assess different LLM capabilities, with links to papers and datasets.\n*   Limitations of LLM evaluation benchmarks.\n\nLet’s dive in!\n\nTL;DR\n-----\n\n*   **LLM benchmarks**are standardized tests that assess LLM performance across various tasks. Typically, they check if the model can produce the correct known response to a given input.\n*   **Common LLM benchmarks** test models for skills like language understanding, question-answering, math problem-solving, and coding tasks. **Examples**are HellaSwag, BigBench, TruthfulQA, and Chatbot Arena.\n*   Publicly available benchmarks make it easy to **compare**the capabilities of different LLMs, often showcased on **leaderboards**.\n*   Limitations of LLM benchmarks include potential **data contamination**, where models are trained on the same data they’re later tested on, **narrow focus**, and loss of relevance over time as model capabilities surpass benchmarks.\n*   While LLM benchmarks help compare LLMs, they are not suitable for[**evaluating****LLM-based products**](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-evaluation), which require custom datasets and criteria tailored to the use case.\n\nBuild AI systems you can rely on\n\nTest fast, ship faster.

They answer questions like: can this LLM handle coding tasks well? Does it give relevant answers in a conversation? How well does it solve reasoning problems?\n\nYou can think of each LLM benchmark as a specialized “exam.” Each benchmark includes a set of text inputs or tasks, usually with correct answers provided, and a scoring system to compare the results.\n\nFor example, the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark includes multiple-choice questions on mathematics, history, computer science, law, and more.\n\n![Image 29: MMLU questions example](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6720df2b878e5e2b000f578d_6720dde820f816f97747f9c5_06_mmlu-question-example-min.png)\n\n_Example questions from the MMLU benchmark. Credit:_[_Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300)\n\nAfter you run an LLM through the benchmark, you can assess the correctness of its answers against the “ground truth” and get a quantitative score to compare and rank different LLMs.\n\nWhile MMLU tests general knowledge, there are benchmarks targeting other areas like:\n\n*   **Language skills,** including logical inference and text comprehension.\n*   **Math problem-solving**, with tasks from basic arithmetic to complex calculus.\n*   **Coding**, testing the ability to generate code and solve programming challenges.\n*   **Conversation**, assessing the quality of responses in a dialogue.\n*   **Safety**, checking if models avoid harmful responses and resist manipulation.\n*   **Domain-specific knowledge**, such as for fields like law and finance.\n\n##### **[fs-toc-omit]100+ examples of LLM benchmarks**\n\n> Want more examples of LLM benchmarks? We put together [database](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-evaluation-benchmarks-datasets)of 100+ LLM benchmarks and datasets you can use to evaluate the performance of language models.[Bookmark the list ⟶](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-evaluation-benchmarks-datasets)\n\nLLM benchmarks vary in difficulty. Early ones focused on basic tasks like classifying text or completing sentences, which worked well for evaluating smaller models like BERT. Now, with powerful models like GPT, Claude, or LLaMA, benchmarks have become more sophisticated and often include complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning.\n\nLLM benchmarks are created by research groups, universities, tech companies, and open-source communities. Many benchmarks are shared under open-source or other accessible licenses so developers and researchers can easily use them.\n\n![Image 30: LLM evaluation benchmarks](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6772b4807bf6af1d802384b3_6772b4710992b17d04510e47_cheerful-robot-students-take-exam%2520(1)%2520(1).jpeg)\n\nWhy we need LLM benchmarks\n--------------------------\n\n**Evaluation standardization and transparency.** LLM benchmarks provide consistent, reproducible ways to assess and rank how well different LLMs handle specific tasks. They allow for an "apples-to-apples" comparison—like grading all students in a class on the same tests.\n\nWhenever a new LLM is released, benchmarks help communicate how it stacks up against others, giving a snapshot of its overall abilities. With shared evaluation standards, others can also independently verify these results using the same tests and metrics.\n\n**Progress tracking and fine-tuning.**LLM benchmarks also serve as progress markers. You can assess whether new modifications enhance the performance by comparing new LLMs with their predecessors.\n\nWe can already see a history where certain benchmarks became outdated as models consistently surpassed them, pushing researchers to develop more challenging benchmarks to keep up with advanced LLM capabilities.\n\nYou can also use benchmarks to identify the model’s weak spots. For instance, a safety benchmark can show how well a given LLM handles novel threats. This, in turn, guides the fine-tuning process and helps LLM researchers advance the field.\n\n**Model selection.** For practitioners, benchmarks also provide a useful reference when deciding which model to use in specific applications.\n\nSay, you’re building a customer support chatbot powered by an LLM. You’d need a model with strong conversational skills–one that can engage in dialogue, maintain context, and provide helpful responses. Which commercial or open-source LLMs should you consider using? By looking at the performance of different models on relevant benchmarks, you can narrow down your shortlist to ones that do well on standard tests.\n\n![Image 31: LLM evaluation benchmarks](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6772b3d94d2ae2e17f1407fd_6772b3c640850ea32345d15a_cheerful-robot-on-a-pedestal-with-a-gold-medal%2520(1)%2520(1).jpeg)\n\nHow LLM benchmarks work\n-----------------------\n\nLLM benchmarks evaluate LLMs on fixed tests. But how exactly do they function?\n\nIn short, benchmarks expose models to a variety of test inputs and measure their performance using standardized metrics for easy comparison and ranking.\n\nLet’s explore the process step by step!\n\n**1. Dataset input and testing**\n\nA benchmark includes tasks for a model to complete, like solving math problems, writing code, answering questions, or translating text. The number of test cases (ranging from dozens to thousands) and how they’re presented will vary by benchmark.\n\nOften, it’s a **dataset of text inputs:**the LLM must process each input and produce a specific response, like completing a sentence, selecting the correct option from multiple choices, or generating a free-form text. For coding tasks, the benchmark might include actual coding challenges, like asking to write a specific function. Some benchmarks also provide prompt templates to instruct the LLM on processing the inputs.\n\nMost benchmarks come with a set of “**ground truth**” answers to compare against, though alternative evaluation methods exist, like Chatbot Arena, which uses crowdsourced human labels. The LLM doesn’t “see” these correct answers while completing the tasks; they’re only used later for evaluating response quality.\n\n**2. Performance evaluation and scoring**\n\nOnce the model completes the benchmark tasks, you can measure its quality! Each benchmark includes a scoring mechanism to quantify how well an LLM performs, with different [evaluation methods](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-evaluation-metrics) suited to different task types. Here are some examples:\n\n*   **Classification Metrics**like [accuracy](https://www.evidentlyai.com/classification-metrics/accuracy-precision-recall#what-is-accuracy). These metrics are ideal for tasks with a single correct answer. For instance, the MMLU benchmark uses multiple-choice questions, allowing us to simply calculate the percentage of correct responses across the dataset.\n\n*   **Overlap-based metrics**like BLEU and ROUGE**.** They are used for tasks like translation or free-form responses, where various phrasing options are valid, and an exact match is rare. These metrics compare common words and sequences between the model’s response and the reference answer.\n*   **Functional code quality.** Some coding benchmarks, like HumanEval, use unique metrics such as pass@k, which reflects how many generated code samples pass unit tests for given problems.\n*   **Fine-tuned evaluator models.**The TruthfulQA benchmark uses a fine-tuned evaluator called "GPT-Judge" (based on GPT-3) to assess the truthfulness of answers by classifying them as true or false.\n*   [**LLM-as-a-judge**](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge). MT-bench introduced LLM-based evaluation to approximate human preferences. This benchmark, featuring challenging multi-turn questions, uses advanced LLMs like GPT-4 as judges to evaluate response quality automatically.\n\n**3. LLM ranking and LLM leaderboards**\n\nAs you run multiple LLMs through the benchmark, you can rank them based on achieved scores. One way to visualize how different models compare is a **leaderboard:**a ranking system that shows how different models perform on a specific benchmark or set of benchmarks.\n\nMany benchmarks come with their own leaderboards, often published with the original research paper that introduced the benchmark. These leaderboards provide a snapshot of model performance when first tested on available models.\n\nIn addition, there are public, cross-benchmark leaderboards that aggregate scores from multiple benchmarks and are regularly updated as new models are released. For example, Hugging Face hosts an open LLM leaderboard that ranks various open-source models based on popular benchmarks (stay tuned—we’ll cover these in the next chapter!).\n\n> **Examples of LLM leaderboards:**[MMLU leaderboard](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/multi-task-language-understanding-on-mmlu), [Chatbot Arena leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard), [Hugging Face collection of LLM leaderboards](https://huggingface.co/collections/open-llm-leaderboard/the-big-benchmarks-collection-64faca6335a7fc7d4ffe974a)\n\n![Image 32: Open LLM leaderboard example](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/660ef16a9e0687d9cc27474a/6720df2b878e5e2b000f5793_6720deae18d16faf3156f699_03_llm_leaderboard_example.png)\n\n_Example leaderboard based on the common LLM benchmarks.

LLM benchmarks vary depending on the task—e.g., text classification, machine translation, question answering, reasoning, etc. We will cover some of the commonly used ones. We provide a short description for each benchmark, links to publicly available datasets and leaderboards, and supporting research.\n\n### Reasoning and language understanding benchmarks\n\n#### **[fs-toc-omit]**AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)\n\n**Assets:**[ARC dataset (HuggingFace)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/ai2_arc), [ARC leaderboard](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/arc/submissions/public)\n\n**Research:**[Think you have Solved Question Answering?

Public test data can unintentionally leak into datasets used to train LLMs, compromising evaluation integrity. If a model has seen specific answers during training, it may "know" them rather than demonstrate a true ability to solve that task. One approach to prevent this is to keep some benchmark data private and regularly create new or expand existing benchmark datasets.\n\n**Benchmarks can quickly become outdated.** Once a model achieves the highest possible score on a particular benchmark, that benchmark loses its effectiveness as a measure of progress. This necessitates the creation of more difficult and nuanced tasks to keep pushing the boundaries of LLM development. Many of the existing benchmarks already lost their relevance as modern LLMs progress in their abilities.\n\n**Benchmarks may not reflect real-world performance.** Many benchmarks are built around specific, well-defined tasks that may not fully capture the complexity and variety of scenarios encountered in real-world applications. As a result, a model that excels in benchmarks may still fail on applied tasks, even those that seem straightforward.\n\n**Benchmarks aren’t enough for evaluating LLM apps.**Generic LLM benchmarks are useful for testing models but don’t work for LLM-powered applications. In real apps like chatbots or virtual assistants, it’s not just the model—you also have prompts, external knowledge databases, and business logic to consider. To test these systems effectively, you’ll need “your own” benchmarks: those that include real, application-specific inputs and standards for correct behavior.\n\nCreate a benchmark for your AI system\n-------------------------------------\n\nLLM benchmarks are great for comparing models, but when building an AI product, you need custom [test datasets](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-test-dataset-synthetic-data) that reflect your use case. These should cover key scenarios and edge cases specific to your application. You\'ll also need task-specific evaluations, like [LLM judges](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge) tuned to your custom criteria and preferences.\n\nThat’s why we built [Evidently](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge).

[Wrapping up](/resources/understanding-llm-evaluation-and-benchmarks#wrapping-up)\n\nAs large language models (LLMs) become integral to business workflows, ensuring their reliability and efficiency is crucial. As a result, the importance of deploying robust evaluation and benchmarking techniques for successful model implementation cannot be understated.\n\nLLMs are assessed on various tasks, including language generation, translation, reasoning, summarization, question-answering, and relevance. Comprehensive evaluations help build robust and secure models across different dimensions while detecting any regressions over time.\n\n## What is LLM evaluation?\n\n![Fundamentals of LLM evaluation](https://images.prismic.io/turing/ZfLAR0mNsf2sHkok_FundamentalsofLLMevaluation.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nLLM evaluation involves measuring and assessing a model\'s performance across key tasks. This process uses various metrics to determine how well the model predicts or generates text, understands context, summarizes data, and responds to queries. Evaluation is crucial for identifying a model\'s strengths and weaknesses, offering insights for improvement, and guiding the [fine-tuning](https://www.turing.com/resources/finetuning-large-language-models) process.\n\n### Types of evaluation: Model evaluation vs. system evaluation\n\nWhen evaluating LLMs, it\'s important to distinguish between two primary types: model evaluation and system evaluation. Both are vital for assessing an LLM\'s overall effectiveness, though they focus on different aspects.\n\n#### Model evaluation\n\nModel evaluation focuses on the internal capabilities and performance of the LLM itself. It examines how well the model performs specific tasks like text generation, language understanding, translation, and summarization. This evaluation typically includes:\n\n- **Intrinsic metrics:** These metrics assess the model\'s fundamental properties, such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and F1 score, which help gauge its ability to generate coherent, relevant, and grammatically correct text.\n- **Fine-tuning and validation:** This involves evaluating the model during and after fine-tuning on specific datasets to ensure it generalizes well and produces accurate results consistent with the training data.\n\n#### System evaluation\n\nSystem evaluation focuses on the LLM’s performance within a larger system or application, assessing its effectiveness in real-world scenarios and its integration with other components like user interfaces, databases, and external APIs. This evaluation typically involves:\n\n- **Extrinsic metrics:** These metrics measure the system’s overall performance in completing end-to-end tasks, such as accurately answering user queries, performing sentiment analysis, or generating reports in a production environment.\n- **User experience and usability:** This aspect considers how intuitive and responsive the system is when interacting with the LLM, evaluating factors like latency, scalability, and user satisfaction.\n- **Robustness and reliability:** This involves testing the model’s robustness against diverse inputs, including edge cases, noisy data, and unexpected queries, ensuring the system remains reliable under varying conditions.\n\nBy incorporating both model and system evaluations, companies can develop AI systems that are not only technically proficient but also practical and user-friendly.\n\n## How does your LLM stack up against the best?\n\nUnderstanding model vs. system evaluation is just the first step. Now, put your LLM to the test.

Below are the key criteria essential for assessing the performance and reliability of LLMs across different use cases:\n\n- **Response completeness and conciseness:** Ensures the LLM\'s output is thorough and free of redundancy.\n- **Text similarity metrics:** Assess how closely the generated text aligns with a reference text, focusing on the accuracy and fidelity of the output.\n- **Question answering accuracy:** Measures the LLM’s ability to provide correct and relevant answers to specific questions, ensuring precision and contextual understanding.\n- **Relevance:** Evaluates how well the generated content aligns with the context or query, ensuring that the response is pertinent and appropriate.\n- **Hallucination index:** Tracks the frequency with which the LLM generates information not present in the source data or that is [factually incorrect](https://www.turing.com/resources/minimize-llm-hallucinations-strategy).\n- **Toxicity:** Assesses the model\'s output for harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content, ensuring safe and responsible usage.\n- **Task-specific metrics:** Involves specialized metrics tailored to the specific application of the LLM, such as BLEU for translation or ROUGE for summarization, to measure performance in those particular tasks.\n- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):** Measures the effectiveness of the system in retrieving relevant documents and the accuracy and relevance of the final generated answer based on those documents.\n\n### Key metrics for LLM evaluation\n\nSeveral metrics are commonly used to evaluate LLM performance, each providing unique insights into different aspects of model output:\n\n- **BLEU (Bilingual evaluation understudy):** Often used for machine translation, BLEU calculates the overlap of n-grams (a contiguous sequence of n items from a given text sample) between the model’s output and a set of human-written reference translations. A higher BLEU score indicates better text generation, as the output closely resembles the reference. However, BLEU has limitations, such as its inability to evaluate semantic meaning or the relevance of the generated text.\n- **MoverScore**: A more recent metric designed to measure semantic similarity between two pieces of text. MoverScore uses Word Mover’s Distance, calculating the minimum distance that words in one text need to “travel” to match the distribution of words in another. It then adjusts this distance based on the importance of different words to the text’s overall meaning. MoverScore provides a nuanced evaluation of semantic similarity, but it’s computationally intensive and may not always align with human judgment.\n- **Perplexity**: It quantifies how well a model predicts a sample, typically a piece of text. A lower perplexity score indicates better performance in predicting the next word in a sequence. While useful for quantitative assessment, perplexity doesn’t account for qualitative aspects like coherence or relevance and is often paired with other metrics for a more robust evaluation.\n- **Exact match:** Commonly used in question-answering and machine translation, exact match measures the percentage of predictions that exactly match reference answers. While helpful in gauging accuracy, it doesn’t consider near misses or semantic similarity, making it necessary to use it alongside other, more nuanced metrics.\n- **Precision**: It measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive observations. In LLMs, precision reflects the fraction of correct predictions over the total number of predictions made by the model. A high precision score indicates the model is likely correct when it makes a prediction. However, precision doesn’t account for relevant predictions the model might have missed (false negatives), so it’s often combined with recall for a balanced evaluation.\n- **Recall**: Also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, recall measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model. A high recall score indicates the model’s efficiency in detecting relevant information, but it doesn’t account for irrelevant predictions (false positives). Therefore, recall is often paired with precision for a comprehensive assessment.\n- **F1 score:** The F1 score is a popular metric that balances precision and recall by calculating their harmonic mean—a specific type of average that penalizes extremes more heavily than the arithmetic mean. A high F1 score indicates that the model maintains a good balance between precision and recall, making it particularly useful when both false positives and false negatives are important considerations. The F1 score ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n- **ROUGE (Recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation)**: ROUGE is widely used for tasks like text summarization and has several variants:\n\na. **ROUGE-N** measures the overlap of n-grams between the generated text and the reference text. The formula for ROUGE-N is:\n\n![ROUGE-N metric formula](https://images.prismic.io/turing/Zt57YxoQrfVKl1XH_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nHere’s what each term represents:\n\n- **Match(n-gram):** The maximum number of N-grams co-occurring in a candidate text and a set of reference texts.\n- **Count(n-gram):** The total count of N-grams in the reference summaries.\n\nb. **ROUGE-L** focuses on the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the generated and reference texts, evaluating overall coherence. The formula for ROUGE-L is:\n\n![ROUGE-L metric formula](https://images.prismic.io/turing/Zt57YhoQrfVKl1XG_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams-1-.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nFor example, if the LCS between the candidate and reference summary is 4 words, and the total number of words in the reference summary is 9 words, then ROUGE-L would be calculated as:\n\n![ROUGE-L metric formula](https://images.prismic.io/turing/Zt57YRoQrfVKl1XE_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams-2-.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nc. **ROUGE-S** assesses the overlap of skip-bigrams (two words in order, regardless of the number of words in between) between the texts, which is useful for evaluating the model\'s language flexibility.\n\nEach ROUGE variant offers specific insights but should be used alongside other evaluation methods for a comprehensive assessment.\n\n### Human evaluation parameters\n\nHuman evaluation metrics are vital for assessing the model\'s performance from a qualitative perspective, something that automated metrics might not fully capture. Human evaluators review and rate the model outputs on various aspects such as coherence, relevance, and fluency.   \nUnlike automated metrics that provide immediate, quantitative feedback, human evaluations offer nuanced insights into how well a model\'s output aligns with human judgment and expectations. While this evaluation method can be more time-consuming, it remains essential for a comprehensive LLM evaluation strategy.\n\n## Automated versus human evaluation\n\nAutomated and human evaluations serve distinct yet complementary roles in assessing LLMs. Automated evaluations provide quick, quantitative measures of a model\'s performance by using metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity. However, they may miss nuances and qualitative aspects of the output.   \nOn the other hand, human evaluations capture these nuances by assessing the output coherence, relevance, and fluency. However, a balanced evaluation strategy often combines both automated and human evaluations, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the model\'s performance.\n\n## Benchmarks in LLM training\n\nLLM benchmarks are standard datasets and tasks widely adopted by the research community to assess and compare the performance of various models. These benchmarks include predefined splits for training, validation, and testing, along with established evaluation metrics and protocols.   \nBenchmarks provide a common ground for systematically comparing different models and approaches, assessing progress by setting challenges that models must meet or exceed. While metrics directly assess model output, benchmarks offer a standardized context for understanding the significance of these metrics in terms of progress or capability.\n\n### Prominent benchmarks used for LLM performance measurement\n\nSeveral benchmarks are widely used in the industry to evaluate and quantify LLM performance and relevance. Some of the most prominent LLM benchmarks include:\n\n- **GLUE (general language understanding evaluation):**\xa0 GLUE provides a comprehensive baseline to evaluate and compare model performance across various natural language understanding tasks, such as sentiment analysis, textual entailment, and sentence similarity. By offering a diverse set of challenges, GLUE measures a model\'s ability to understand context, infer meaning, and process language at a level comparable to humans.   \n  This benchmark helps identify LLM strengths and weaknesses, driving progress in natural language processing (NLP) research by encouraging the development of more robust and versatile models.\n- **MMLU (massive multitask language understanding)**:\xa0 MMLU is a challenging LLM benchmark designed to assess the depth of a model’s understanding across a broad spectrum of subjects. It presents models with tasks derived from various domains, including humanities, social sciences, history, computer science, and law. MMLU gauges the breadth of a model\'s knowledge and its capacity for complex reasoning, contextual understanding, and transfer learning.   \n  This benchmark is pivotal in developing LLMs capable of generating contextual text across diverse domains, though it\'s important to note that MMLU is sensitive to how it’s implemented.\n- **DeepEval**: DeepEval is an open-source framework designed to simplify the evaluation of LLMs, enabling easy iteration and development of LLM applications. It allows users to "unit test" LLM outputs similar to how Pytest is used, making evaluation intuitive and straightforward. The framework includes over 14 pre-built, research-backed metrics that can be easily customized to fit various use cases.   \n  DeepEval also supports synthetic dataset generation using advanced evolution techniques, and it enables real-time evaluations in production environments, ensuring models perform effectively in live applications.\n- **AlpacaEval**: AlpacaEval is an automated LLM evaluation framework that measures the ability of LLMs to follow general user instructions. It utilizes the AlpacaFarm evaluation set, which includes a variety of instructions, and employs a GPT-4-based auto-annotator to compare model responses to reference models. The results are displayed as win rates on the AlpacaEval leaderboard.   \n  This benchmark provides valuable insights into how well a model handles complex, task-oriented prompts, promoting the development of more useful and reliable LLMs.\n- **HELM (holistic evaluation of language models):** HELM aims to increase LLM transparency by offering a comprehensive assessment framework. It covers a diverse array of scenarios and metrics to examine the capabilities and limitations of language models.

Current LLM evaluation benchmarks face several challenges and limitations:\n\n- **Influence of prompts:** Performance metrics may be sensitive to specific prompts, potentially masking the actual capabilities of the model.\n- **Construct validity:** Establishing acceptable answers for diverse use cases is challenging because of the broad spectrum of tasks involved.\n- **Insufficient standardization:** The lack of standardized benchmarks leads researchers and experts to use varying benchmarks and implementations, resulting in inconsistent and sometimes incomparable evaluation results.\n- **Human evaluations:** While essential for capturing qualitative aspects, human evaluations are time-consuming, expensive, and potentially inconsistent, which can hinder the efficiency of tasks requiring subjective judgment, such as abstractive summaries.\n- **Data diversity and representativeness:** Many benchmarks may not fully capture the variety of languages, dialects, cultural contexts, or specialized knowledge that LLMs may encounter in practical applications. This can lead to models that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail in more diverse or niche environments.\n- **Handling biases and ethical concerns:** Identifying and mitigating biased outputs is a significant challenge, as is understanding the underlying causes of these biases. Additionally, the ethical implications of deploying LLMs in sensitive domains require careful consideration during the evaluation process.\n- **Ensuring robustness and generalization:** It’s critical to test models against a wide array of scenarios, including rare or unexpected situations in real-world applications. Ensuring that LLMs can handle these situations without performance degradation is essential for their reliable deployment.\n- **Prioritizing the right evaluation benchmarks:** With the growing number of evaluation methods and tools, organizations often struggle to select the most relevant benchmarks, leading to either over-evaluating, which is resource-intensive, or under-evaluating, missing critical insights. Expert guidance is needed to navigate this landscape and choose the benchmarks that best align with specific goals and use cases.\n\n## Key considerations for effective LLM evaluation protocols\n\nDefining effective evaluation protocols is essential for creating a robust framework that accurately assesses the performance and utility of LLMs. These protocols should incorporate a mix of automated and human evaluations, diverse benchmarks, and [ethical considerations](https://www.turing.com/resources/implementing-security-guardrails-for-llms).\n\n![Defining effective evaluation protocols](https://images.prismic.io/turing/ZfLQSUmNsf2sHkvm_Definingeffectiveevaluationprotocols.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nTailoring these protocols to the specific use case of the model ensures a comprehensive and relevant assessment. Key considerations for effective evaluation include:\n\n- **Clear objectives for LLM evaluation:** The evaluation objectives should align with the model\'s intended use case, whether it\'s for text generation, translation, summarization, or another task. These objectives should guide the selection of evaluation metrics and benchmarks to ensure they accurately measure the model\'s performance in the most relevant areas. This approach helps identify the model\'s strengths and weaknesses, guiding further improvements.\n- **Choosing relevant metrics and benchmarks:** The selected metrics should align with the evaluation objectives and provide a comprehensive view of the model\'s performance. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score can measure accuracy, while BLEU and ROUGE are useful for assessing text generation quality.   \n  Benchmarks should be chosen based on their ability to evaluate the model across various tasks relevant to its use case. The choice of metrics and benchmarks significantly influences the evaluation outcomes and the model’s subsequent fine-tuning.\n- **Balancing quantitative and qualitative analyses:** Quantitative analysis through automated metrics offers objective measures of a model\'s performance but may not capture all nuances across different tasks. Complementing this with qualitative human analysis helps assess aspects like coherence, relevance, and fluency in the model\'s output.   \n  This balance ensures a more holistic understanding of the model\'s capabilities and limitations, ensuring it not only performs well statistically but also generates high-quality, meaningful outputs.\n\n## Latest developments in LLM evaluation\n\nResearchers in the field of natural language generation (NLG) continue to work on evaluation frameworks for a more reliable and robust assessment of LLMs. Some of the recent developments include:\n\n### **Werewolf Arena**\n\nIntroduced by Google Research for evaluating LLMs, this framework leverages the classic game "Werewolf" to evaluate LLMs on their abilities in strategic reasoning, deception, and communication. This framework introduces dynamic turn-taking, where models bid for their chance to speak, simulating real-world conversational dynamics. By competing in an arena-style tournament, models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT series were tested, revealing significant differences in their strategic and communicative approaches. This innovative evaluation method offers a more interactive and challenging benchmark for assessing the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs.\n\n![Game loop of werewolf](https://images.prismic.io/turing/Zt57XRoQrfVKl1XD_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams-3-.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\n[Original image source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13943)\n\n### **G-Eval**\n\nAlso known as GPT-Eval, it’s a unique framework that focuses on using existing LLMs such as GPT-4 to assess the quality of texts generated by the NLG systems.\n\n![G-Eval framework](https://images.prismic.io/turing/ZwUWrYF3NbkBXAdN_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams-5-.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\n[Original image source](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2303.16634)   \nThis evaluation method focuses on enhancing human alignment in assessing the quality of generated text outputs. By incorporating a chain-of-thought (CoT) approach and a form-filling paradigm, G-Eval aims to provide a more accurate and reliable evaluation of LLM outputs. Through experiments in tasks like text summarization and dialogue generation, G-Eval with GPT-4 demonstrates a significant Spearman correlation of 0.514 with human judgments in summarization tasks, surpassing previous evaluation methods by a considerable margin. Spearman\'s correlation coefficient ranges from -1 (strong negative correlation) to +1 (strong positive correlation).\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nEvaluating and benchmarking LLMs are essential for quantifying their reliability and effectiveness across various tasks.

One of the most reliable ways to achieve this is through an understanding of benchmark scores.\n\nWith this in mind, this guide delves into the concept of LLM benchmarks, what the most common benchmarks are and what they entail, and what the drawbacks are of solely relying on benchmarks as an indicator of a model’s performance.\n\n## What are LLM Benchmarks and Why are They Important?\n\nAn LLM benchmark is a\xa0standardised performance test used to evaluate various capabilities of AI language models. A benchmark usually consists of a dataset, a collection of questions or tasks, and a scoring mechanism. After undergoing the benchmark’s evaluation, models are usually awarded a score from 0 to 100.\n\nBenchmarks are valuable to organisations, namely product managers and developers, and users because they provide an objective indication of an LLM’s performance. Providing a common, standardised collection of assessments to measure LLMs, makes it easier to compare one model against another and, ultimately, select the best one for your proposed use case.\n\nAdditionally, benchmarks are incredibly useful to LLM developers and AI researchers as they provide a quantitative consensus on what constitutes good performance. Benchmark scores reveal where a model excels and, conversely and more importantly, where it falls short. Subsequently, developers can compare their model’s performance against their competition and make necessary improvements. The transparency that well-constructed benchmarks foster allows those in the LLM field to build off each other’s progress – accelerating the overall advancement of language models in the process.\n\n## Popular LLM Benchmarks\n\nHere’s a selection of the most commonly used LLM benchmarks, along with their pros and cons.\n\n### ARC\n\n[AI2 Reasoning Challenge\xa0(ARC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05457) is a question-answer (QA) benchmark that’s designed to test an LLM’s knowledge and reasoning skills. ARC’s dataset consists of7787four-optionmultiple-choice science questions\xa0that range from a 3rd to 9th-grade difficulty level. ARC’s questions are divided into Easy and Challenge sets that test different types of knowledge such as factual, definition, purpose, spatial, process, experimental, and algebraic.\n\nARC was devised to be a more comprehensive and difficult benchmark than previous QA benchmarks, such as the Stanford Question and Answer Dataset (SQuAD)\xa0or\xa0the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus, which only tended to measure a model’s ability to extract the correct answer from a passage. To achieve this, the ARC corpus provides distributed evidence: typically containing most of the information required to answer a question – but spreading the pertinent details throughout a passage. This requires a language model to solve ARC questions through its knowledge and reasoning abilities instead of explicitly memorising the answers.\n\n#### Pros and cons of the ARC benchmark\n\n**Pros**\n\n**Cons**\n\n### HellaSwag\n\n[HellaSwag](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07830.pdf)\xa0(short for Harder Endings, Longer contexts, and Low-shot Activities for Situations with Adversarial Generations) benchmark tests the\xa0commonsense reasoningand natural language inference (NLI) capabilities of LLMs through sentence completion exercises. A successor to the SWAG benchmark, each exercise is composed of a segment of a video caption as an initial context and four possible endings, of which only one is correct.\n\nEach question revolves around common, real-world physical scenarios that are designed to be easily answerable for humans (with an average score of around 95%) but challenging for NLP models.\n\nHellaSwag’s corpus was created through\xa0a process called adversarial filtering, an algorithm that increases the complexity by generating deceptive wrong answers, called adversarial endings, which contain words and phrases relevant to the context – but defy conventional knowledge about the world. These adversarial endings are such that they immediately stand out to most people but often prove difficult for LLMs.\n\n#### Pros and Cons of the HellaSwag Benchmark\n\n**Pros**\n\n**Cons**\n\n### MMLU\n\n[Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03300.pdf) is a broad, but important benchmark that measures an LLM’s NLU, i.e., how well it *understands* language and, subsequently, its ability to solve problems with the knowledge to which it was exposed during training. MMLU was devised to challenge models on their NLU capabilities – in contrast to NLP tasks on which a growing number of models were increasingly excelling at the time.\n\nThe MMLU dataset consists of\xa015,908 questions\xa0divided into 57 tasks drawn from a variety of online sources that test both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Its questions cover STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), humanities (language arts, history, sociology, performing and visual arts, etc.),\xa0social\xa0sciences, and\xa0other\xa0subjects from an elementary to\xa0an advanced professional level. This in itself was a departure from other NLU benchmarks at the time of its release (like SuperGLUE), which focused on basic knowledge rather than the specialised knowledge covered by MMLU.\n\n#### Pros and Cons of the MMLU Benchmark\n\n**Pros**\n\n**Cons**\n\n### TruthfulQA\n\nWhile an LLM may be capable of producing coherent and well-constructed responses, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re accurate. The [TruthfulQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07958.pdf)benchmark attempts to address this, i.e., language models’ tendency to hallucinate, by measuring a model’s ability to generate truthful answers to questions.\n\nThere could be several reasons why an LLM produces inaccurate responses. Chief among them is the model being given a lack of training data for particular subjects, rendering it unable to generate a truthful answer. Similarly, the LLM could have been trained on low-quality data that was full of inaccuracies.\xa0 Alternatively, the false answers may have been incentivised during the model’s training, i.e., faulty training objectives: these are known as imitative falsehoods.\n\nTruthfulQA’s dataset is designed in such a way as to encourage models to choose imitative falsehoods instead of true answers.\xa0It assesses the truthfulness of an LLM’s response by how much it describes the literal truth about the real world. Consequently, answers that stem from a particular belief system or works of fiction present in the training data are considered false. Additionally, TruthQA measures how *informative* an answer is – to avoid LLMs attaining high scores by simply responding sceptically with “I don’t know” or “I’m not sure”.\n\nThe TruthQA corpus consists of 817 questions\xa0across 38 categories, such as finance, health, and politics. To calculate a score, each model is put through two tasks. The first requires the model to generate answers to a series of questions. Each response is scored between 0 and 1 by human evaluators, where 0 is false and 1 is true. For the second task, instead of generating an answer, the LLM must choose true or false for a series of multiple-choice questions, which are tallied. The two scores are then combined to produce a final result.\n\n#### Pros and cons of the TruthfulQA benchmark\n\n**Pros**\n\n**Cons**\n\n### WinoGrande\n\n[WinoGrande](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10641.pdf) is a benchmark that evaluates an LLM’s commonsense reasoning abilities and is based on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) machine learning tests. The benchmark presents a series of pronoun resolution problems: where two near-identical sentences have two possible answers, which change based on a trigger word.\n\nWinoGrande’s dataset contains 44,000 well-designed, crowdsource problems – which is a significant increase from the 273 problems in the WSC. Additionally, the AFLITE\xa0algorithm, which is based on HellaSwag’s adversarial filtering algorithm, was applied to the dataset to both increase its complexity and reduce any inherent bias, i.e., annotation artefacts.\n\n#### Pros and Cons of the WinoGrande Benchmark\n\n**Pros**\n\n**Cons**\n\n### GSM8K\n\nThe [GSM8K](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14168.pdf) (which stands for Grade School Math 8K) benchmark measures a model’s multi-step mathematical reasoning abilities. It contains a corpus of around 8,500 grade-school-level math word problems devised by humans, which is divided into 7,500 training problems and 1,00 test problems.\n\nEach problem requires two to eight steps to solve and to carry out a sequence of fairly simple calculations using the basic arithmetic operators (+ − ×÷). The solution to each problem is collected in natural language form as opposed to a mathematical expression.\n\n#### Pros and Cons of the GSM8K Benchmark\n\n**Pros**\n\n**Cons**\n\n### SuperGLUE\n\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark tests an LLM’s NLU capabilities and was notable upon its release for its variety of assessments. [SuperGLUE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00537.pdf) improves upon GLUE with a more diverse and challenging collection of tasks that assess a model’s performance across eight subtasks and two metrics, with their average providing an overall score.\n\nHere’s a summary of the SuperGLUE benchmark’s subtasks and metrics:\n\n#### Pros and cons of the SuperGLUE benchmark\n\n**Pros**\n\n**Cons**\n\n### HumanEval\n\n[HumanEval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03374.pdf) (also often referred to as HumanEval-Python) is a benchmark designed to measure a model’s ability to generate functionally correct code; it consists of\xa0the HumanEval dataset\xa0and\xa0the pass@k metric.\n\nThis HumanEval dataset was carefully designed and contains 164 diverse coding challenges that include several unit tests (7.7 on average).The pass@k metric calculates the probability that at least one of ***k*** generated code samples pass the coding challenge’s unit tests, given that there are ***c*** correct samples from ***n*** generated samples.\n\nIn the past, the BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy)metric was used to assess the textual similarity of model-generated coding solutions compared with human ones. The problem with this approach, however as it doesn’t evaluate the functional correctness of the generated solution; for more complex problems, the solution could still be functionally correct while appearing different textually from the solution produced by a person. The HumanEval addressed this by utilising unit tests to evaluate a code sample’s functionality in a similar way that humans would.\n\n#### Pros and cons of the HumanEval benchmark\n\n**Pros**\n\n**Cons**\n\n### MT Bench\n\n[MT-Bench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05685.pdf) is a benchmark that evaluates a language model’s capability to effectively engage in multi-turn dialogues. By simulating the back-and-forth conversations that LLMs would have in real-life situations, MT-Bench provides a way to measure how effectively chatbots follow instructions and the natural flow of conversations.\n\nMT Bench was developed through the use of Chatbot Arena: a crowd-sourced platform that allows users to evaluate a variety of chatbots by entering a prompt and comparing the two responses side-by-side. Users could then vote for which model provided the best response, which was recorded and tallied to produce a leaderboard of the best-performing LLMs.\n\nThrough this process, the researchers behind Chatbot Arena identified\xa0eight main typesof user prompts: writing, roleplay, extraction, reasoning, math, coding, knowledge I (STEM), and knowledge II (humanities). Subsequently, they devised 10 multi-turn questions per category, to create a total set of\xa0160 questions. While the results from Chatbot Arena are subjective, MT-Bench is intended to complement it with a more objective measure of a model’s conversational capabilities.\n\n#### Pros and Cons of the MT-Bench Benchmark\n\n**Pros**\n\n**Cons**\n\n## What are LLM leaderboards?\n\nAlthough understanding what various benchmarks signify about a particular LLM’s performance is important, it is also necessary to establish how models compare against *each other* to choose the best one for your needs: this is where LLM leaderboards come in.\n\nAN LLM leaderboard is a published list of benchmark results for each language model. The designers of each benchmark tend to maintain their own LLM leaderboards, but there are also independent leaderboards that evaluate models on a series of benchmarks for a more comprehensive assessment of their abilities.\n\nThe best example of these are the leaderboards featured on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/collections/open-llm-leaderboard/the-big-benchmarks-collection-64faca6335a7fc7d4ffe974a) that evaluate and rank a large variety of open-source LLMS based on six of the benchmarks detailed above –\xa0 ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthQA, WinoGrade, and GSM8K\n\n## What are the Problems with LLM Benchmarking?\n\nWhile LLM benchmarks are undoubtedly helpful in general, the best practice is to use them as a guide – or at best a strong indicator – of a model’s capabilities, and not a definitive one.\n\nThe first reason for this is benchmark leakage, which refers to instances where an LLM is trained on the same data contained in benchmark datasets. As a result, the model has a chance to learn the solutions to the challenges posed by particular benchmarks, i.e., overfitting, instead of actually solving them – so the model’s\xa0 score isn’t truly reflective of its capabilities in the aspect being assessed. Worse, as a benchmark becomes increasingly established and widespread, models can be trained or fine-tuned to score highly, and become less useful on the specific tasks being measured – a manifestation of [Goodhart’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).\n\nAnother issue with LLM benchmarks is that a model’s score may not accurately reflect how it will perform when applied to a real-world use case. Benchmarking takes place in controlled settings, with a finite dataset, and with evaluators looking for a model to fulfil specific criteria. This stands in contrast to the unpredictability and variety of real-world applications, which makes it difficult to predict the “in-field” performance of a particular LLM.\n\nConversation-based LLMs are a prominent example of this, as it is hard for benchmarks to account for the unpredictability of conversations. While benchmarks mainly measure a model’s performance on self-contained short tasks, it is difficult to determine how long a real conversation is going to be. Although MT-Bench is designed to assess an LLM’s ability to engage in conversation, it only does so for a limited number of questions – and uses a small, albeit carefully crafted, dataset.\n\nAdditionally, on the subject of datasets, as benchmarking is mostly carried out with corpora containing broad, general knowledge, it is hard to determine how well a model will perform in a specific or specialised domain. Subsequently, the more specific the use case, the less applicable a benchmark score is likely to be.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBenchmarking offers a clear and objective way to assess an LLM’s capabilities and compare how well models perform in relation to each other. As the use of LLMs is projected to rapidly increase over the next few years, benchmarks will become increasingly important for helping organisations decide which language models best suit their long-term objectives. For all their benefits, LLM benchmarks aren’t perfect – which is why machine learning researchers are constantly developing and refining methods of measuring a model’s performance.\n\nIn this guide, we explore the concept of context length, why it is important, and the benefits and drawbacks of differing context lengths.\n\n![Avatar photo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\'%20viewBox=\'0%200%20120%20120\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![Avatar photo](https://symbl.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kartik-Talamadupula-120x120.jpeg)\n\n##### [Kartik Talamadupula](https://symbl.ai/developers/blog/author/kartik-talamadupula/ "Kartik Talamadupula")\n\n###### Director of AI Research\n\nKartik Talamadupula is a research scientist who has spent over a decade applying AI techniques to business problems in automation, human-AI collaboration, and NLP.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\n![Symbl AI](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\'%20viewBox=\'0%200%20223%2052\'%3E%3C/svg%3E "Symbl AI")\n![Symbl AI](https://symbl.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/symbl-logo-large-white.svg "Symbl AI")\n\nSymbl.ai powers agentic AI for human conversations — transforming unstructured communication into intelligent, real-time assistance and automation.\n\n#### Platform\n\n[Nebula LLM](https://symbl.ai/platform/nebula/llm/)  \n[Call Score](https://symbl.ai/platform/generative-apis/call-score/)\n\n#### Developers\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.symbl.ai/docs?_ga=2.177113445.112051728.1695639554-2506386136.1670379594&_gl=1*105yykv*_ga*MjUwNjM4NjEzNi4xNjcwMzc5NTk0*_ga_FN4MP7CES4*MTY5NjAwMzU2NC40My4xLjE2OTYwMDQwMzAuMC4wLjA.)  \n[Platform](https://platform.symbl.ai/#/signup)  \n[Nebula Playground](https://nebula.symbl.ai)  \n[SDKs](https://docs.symbl.ai/page/sdks)  \n[Research](https://symbl.ai/research/)  \n[Blog](https://symbl.ai/developers/blog/)\n\n#### Company\n\n[About](https://symbl.ai/company/about/)  \n[Request a Demo](https://symbl.ai/company/request-a-demo/)\n\n© 2025 Symbl.ai All rights reserved.\n\n[Request a Demo](/company/request-a-demo/)\n\n[Terms of Service](/termsofservice/)\n\n[Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/)\n\n![](https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=3116946&fmt=gif)')]), SearchResults(query=Query(query='common pitfalls and limitations in interpreting LLM benchmarks overfitting context-sensitivity'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.honeyhive.ai/post/avoiding-common-pitfalls-in-llm-evaluation', title='Avoiding Common Pitfalls in LLM Evaluation', raw_content='![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65483e3a00a324531a626c95_63f13bee638d6993e08555fb_logo2.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65a4b26bc64d1938805c363d_image%20(226).png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65483e3a00a324531a626d04_data-analytics.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65483e3a00a324531a626d01_computer.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65483e3a00a324531a626d02_check-list.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65483e3a00a324531a626d03_database%20(1).png)\n\nMay 20, 2025\n\n# Avoiding Common Pitfalls in LLM Evaluation\n\nDiscover the hidden challenges of LLM evaluation and the most common mistakes we\'ve seen after helping hundreds of teams build effective evals that drive business results.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c07/681cfaa2bd9349d8acf2f87a_image%20(406).png)\n\nBuilding a successful LLM product depends on knowing how well it performs. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts here - relying on a single score from the latest LLM benchmark wonâ\x80\x99t magically improve your application. It\'s increasingly clear the path to a successful AIÂ\xa0product is built on carefully curated evaluations, rapid iterations, and a clear understanding of the limitations of different evaluation methods and when to use them.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nBefore discussing the limitations and pitfalls of LLM evaluation, itâ\x80\x99s important to distinguish between two related but distinct types of evaluations. Thereâ\x80\x99s a fundamental difference between standardized, public benchmarks designed to measure general model capabilities and the custom, application-specific evaluations that determine whether a system actually meets your needs.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nIn this post, weâ\x80\x99ll clarify the distinction between standardized LLM benchmarks and application-specific evals, and explore some of the most common pitfalls that teams encounter when interpreting eval results. Along the way, weâ\x80\x99ll discuss why high leaderboard scores donâ\x80\x99t always translate to real-world readiness, the challenges of using LLM-as-a-judge, the importance of statistical rigor at different stages of evaluation, and the need for continuous, evolving evals as your product and users change. By understanding these issues, youâ\x80\x99ll be better equipped to design evaluation processes that align with your goals and avoid common traps that weâ\x80\x99ve seen teams run into.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n#### Standardized Benchmarks vs. Application-Specific Evals\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nWhen discussing benchmarks in the context of LLMs, we often refer to two related but distinct concepts: **Standardized Model Benchmarks** and **Application-Specific Evals**. These serve different purposes and have different implications for model development and deployment. Before addressing common misconceptions about LLM benchmarks, itâ\x80\x99s important to distinguish between these two types. Throughout the following sections, we will specify which type of benchmark we are referencing whenever the distinction is relevant.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c07/681bccfb7fd515d63fdce456_Captura%20de%20tela%202025-04-30%20171307.png)\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n**Standardized LLM Benchmarks** â\x80\x94 like MMLU, GLUE, or HellaSwag - are shared, public datasets and tasks designed to measure the general capabilities of a core language model across a wide range of knowledge domains and skills. Their primary purpose is to enable fair comparisons between different foundation models and to track overall progress in the field. However, these benchmarks have significant limitations: they can suffer from data contamination (where test data leaks into training), may not reflect performance on the specific tasks that matter for your application, and can sometimes be â\x80\x9cgamedâ\x80\x9d by optimizing models for benchmark performance rather than real-world utility.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n**Application-Specific Evals** â\x80\x94 in contrast, are tailored to the needs of a particular application or compound AI system. Rather than focusing on the core model in isolation, these evaluations measure how the entire system - including prompts, retrieval components, agents, and other integrations - performs on tasks directly relevant to the intended use case and the surrounding business logic. The goal here is not to compare models in the abstract, but to ensure the system meets user and business needs, uncover specific failure modes, and guide ongoing iterations. Application-specific evals often start small and curated, evolving and blending quantitative metrics with qualitative assessments to capture the nuances of real-world performance.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n#### **Common Pitfalls in LLM Evaluation**\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nWith that in mind, let\'s examine some common misconceptions and pitfalls when interpreting benchmark results and discuss how to approach evaluation in a way that aligns with your goals and use cases.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n##### **Mistaking Benchmark Scores for Real-World Readiness**\n\nIt\'s tempting to assume that high scores on standardized benchmarks automatically translate to good performance in real-world applications. However, a high score on a public benchmark doesn\'t guarantee that simply switching models will significantly improve your application performance. LLM Benchmarks are designed to measure the general capabilities of the core language model across a wide range of knowledge domains or reasoning tasks. While they help compare foundation models and track overall progress in the field, they come with significant limitations. For one, benchmarks can suffer from data contamination, where models have seen parts of the test set during training, artificially inflating their scores.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nIt\'s also important to mention the issue of benchmark saturation - as LLMs become more capable, it\'s not uncommon for the top ranks at a given benchmark to reach close to perfect scores. When this happens, the benchmark loses its usefulness, as it can no longer differentiate one model from the other. This is already the case for multiple benchmarks, such as HumanEval [1] and GSM8K [2], with the top models reaching over 90% overall performance. Benchmark saturation leads to the continuous need to release newer and harder versions for the saturated benchmarks or search other more challenging datasets.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nRelying solely on these scores can lead to a false sense of security. A model that excels on a leaderboard may still stumble when faced with the messy, context-rich, and often ambiguous scenarios encountered in production. This is especially true when moving from evaluating the core LLM to assessing the entire system\'s performance, including prompts, retrieval components, agents, and other integrations.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nRecent research highlights how leaderboard scores can be systematically distorted by selective reporting, private test sets, and unequal access to data[3]. In practice, high rankings may reflect overfitting to the benchmark rather than genuine improvements in real-world capability.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n##### **A single score isnâ\x80\x99t enough**\n\nPerhaps the most crucial aspect to consider is that you need more than a single benchmark score to act and improve upon your application. A real-world system often involves different model capabilities applied to a specific domain and other interactions with external tools, so replacing your current model with a possibly better one is usually just the start of your improvement process. Let\'s take an example of a recipe and nutrition system, where a user could ask things like:\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n"*Iâ\x80\x99m looking for a healthy vegetarian dinner recipe that uses sweet potatoes and spinach. Iâ\x80\x99d like something under 500 calories per serving, and Iâ\x80\x99m allergic to nuts. Can you find a recipe for me, tell me the ingredients, and estimate the calories per serving?â\x80\x9d*\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nA higher score in a general reading comprehension benchmark doesn\'t tell you how the model will behave in context with all the remaining moving parts of your system. To do so, you need to decompose your system into smaller tasks. In this simple example, maybe this could mean something like:\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nIs the system calling the web search API with the proper query, based on the user prompt?\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c07/681bcd5b502b7487fd7d034d_Captura%20de%20tela%202025-05-06%20153408.png)\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nIf only evaluating the final step, you wonâ\x80\x99t know why the response was unsuccessful - did we not retrieve the correct documents, was the ingredients parsing off, or perhaps we failed to adjust the recipe, even if all the upstream processes were correct? More granular evals mean more actionable insights to improve your system. Ultimately, while standardized benchmarks are a valuable tool, they are not a substitute for application-specific evals.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n##### Overlooking the Limits of LLM-Based Evaluation\n\nUsing LLMs as judges is attractive for several reasons. Unlike traditional metrics that require human-written reference texts, LLM judges can directly evaluate open-ended outputs, making it possible to assess tasks where references are scarce or subjective. LLM-based evaluation also scales far beyond what\'s feasible with human annotators, dramatically reducing costs and turnaround time.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nRecent studies have shown that, in some cases, generalist LLMs can achieve high alignment with human evaluators, especially when using advanced models and carefully crafted evaluation prompts [4, 5]. This has led to growing enthusiasm for automating evaluation pipelines with LLMs in the loop.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nHowever, it\'s essential to recognize this approach\'s limitations and potential pitfalls. First, if you use generalist LLMs through APIs, changes to the underlying models are often opaque, hurting the reproducibility of evaluation results. Second, the design of the evaluation process itself is critical.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n###### Designing your evaluation process\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nAchieving reliable results requires careful prompt engineering and clear, unambiguous evaluation criteria. This will require some experimentation for your particular use case, but here are some general recommendations for designing your evaluation prompt:\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n###### Evaluate your evaluators\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nCrucially, it\'s essential to evaluate your evaluators. To do so, the role of the domain expert is key, so you can always have a baseline to compare your evaluator\'s outputs to. This is also helpful in tuning your evaluation prompt, as this process is very circular - you need clear evaluation criteria to be able to grade your outputs, but the act of grading helps you more clearly define those criteria [9]. You don\'t need your domain expert to evaluate all the outputs judged by your evaluator, which would defeat the purpose of using LLMs as a judge, but you can curate a sample of representative examples, and use it to align your automated judge with your baseline continuously. Based on the overall agreement, you can tweak your judge\'s different parameters, as seen in the previous section, and iterate on your experiments to improve the correlation. Don\'t expect it to reach 100%, though - LLMs are stochastic, and so are humans.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nEvaluating your evaluators is an ongoing process, so it\'s essential to set up a process that facilitates your domain expert\'s collaboration. For example, it should be easy to browse through the examples, all the required information should be centralized, and the annotations should be easily discoverable by the rest of the team.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n###### Other limitations and biases\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nLLM judges also inherit the well-known limitations of LLMs in general. They can hallucinate, make factual errors, or struggle to follow complex instructions- issues that can directly impact the quality and reliability of their evaluations. Studies have found that LLM judges may exhibit systematic biases, such as favoring LLM-generated outputs over high-quality human-written text [4], or assigning scores that diverge significantly from those given by human annotators, even on relatively simple tasks[5]. This is not an exhaustive list - the table below illustrates additional biases that can influence evaluation outcomes.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c07/681bcd908ec58b8f900a8cda_Captura%20de%20tela%202025-05-06%20181342.png)\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nIn short, LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a powerful tool for scaling up assessment and reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Still, it is not a perfect substitute for human judgment. Over-reliance on automated evaluation can mask important failure modes, introduce new biases, and ultimately lead to overconfidence in system performance. Human-in-the-loop evaluation remains essential for critical applications, and LLM-based judgments should always be interpreted with appropriate caution and context.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n##### Misapplying Statistical Rigor Across Evaluation Stages\n\nWhen evaluating LLMs, itâ\x80\x99s essential to recognize that not all evaluation stages require the same level of statistical rigor. The goals and appropriate methods differ depending on whether you\'re running quick, custom tests, or reporting results from standardized benchmarks.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nIn early-stage, custom evaluations, it\'s common - and often necessary - to work with small, hand-picked datasets. Here, the goal is to identify failure modes, spot qualitative issues, or iterate quickly on model behavior. Demanding strict statistical significance at this stage can be counterproductive, as the focus is on exploration rather than precise measurement. For example, if you\'re just trying to find out whether your model can handle a new type of prompt, running a handful of examples is often enough to guide further development.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nHowever, the need for statistical rigor increases as evaluations mature, especially when comparing models or reporting results on standardized benchmarks. Here, the goal shifts to making reliable, quantitative claims about model performance. This is where issues like dataset size, the number of evaluation runs, and the inherent non-determinism of LLMs become critical. LLMs can produce different outputs for the same input due to their probabilistic nature, so results from a single run or a small dataset may not reflect true performance. Without sufficient data or repeated measurements, you risk being misled by random fluctuations - a classic case of "the curse of small numbers" [11].\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nIt\'s also important to recognize that the transition from qualitative to quantitative evaluation is not a sharp line, but depends on your goals, the maturity of your system, and the decisions you intend to make based on the results. For instance, if you\'re deciding whether to ship a new model version based on benchmark results, statistical rigor is essential. But a handful of examples may suffice if you\'re just trying to identify new error types.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nThe main pitfall is either demanding statistical significance too early, wasting effort on exploratory tests, or failing to apply it when it matters, leading to unreliable or misleading comparisons. Understanding the purpose of your evaluation at each stage helps avoid both traps.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n#### **The Case for Continuous Evaluation**\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nA common pitfall in LLM benchmarking is treating custom evaluation as a one-time task, relying on static offline datasets that quickly become outdated as your product and its users evolve. The real world is a very dynamic environment; along with it, your users\' behaviors also change over time. That means your input data experience distribution shifts, usage patterns change, user expectations evolve, and new failure modes emerge. The direct consequence is that your evaluation dataset must accompany this shift. Otherwise, it will fail to catch regressions and miss new vulnerabilities. This phenomenon is known as **Dataset Drift**, but it\'s also not the only type of drift you should be aware of.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nNot only should your dataset be continuously updated, but your evaluation criteria also evolve with time. To grade your outputs, you need clear evaluation criteria, but the process of grading often helps you to iterate and improve on your evaluation criteria. In the paper by [Shankar et al., â\x80\x9cWho Validates the Validators?"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12272), it was observed that, when grading the outputs of LLM-as-a-judge evaluators, human graders would often refine their criteria when observing new types of incorrect LLM outputs, or adjust the criteria to fit better the LLMs behavior, which they call **Criteria Drift**.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nThe bottom line is that you need to continuously iterate on your evaluations, updating your datasets and refining your evaluation criteria. Your evals should be treated as living documents, regularly updated in response to observed failures, changing requirements, and new user interactions. Here are some general recommendations:\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nThe most effective evaluation processes close the loop between offline and online data, creating a continuous feedback cycle. This ongoing iteration ensures that your benchmarks remain relevant and your system is tested against the real challenges it faces in the wild. The insights and visibility gained from your tuned custom evals will guide you on what changes you need to make to improve your application, be it fine-tuning your models, changing your prompts, or adjusting any other step in your pipeline.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c07/681bcdae5d45ff0cc165d7af_Captura%20de%20tela%202025-05-06%20183313.png)\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nThe most successful LLM teams treat evaluation as a living, iterative practice. They blend quantitative and qualitative methods, continuously update their test sets with real user data, and maintain a healthy skepticism toward any single metric or approach. By grounding your evaluation strategy in the realities of your application and remaining vigilant to new challenges as they arise, you can build LLM systems that are impressive on paper and truly robust, reliable, and valuable in the hands of your users.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n#### References\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\n###### About the author:\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c07/68094d48eaa598ec8a61245d_felipe.jpeg)\n\n###### Felipe Adachi\n\n## Join our monthly newsletter\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65483e3a00a324531a626c95_63f13bee638d6993e08555fb_logo2.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/677f35c10bc3f921841c15e5_soc-2.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/681e4fe8f4823e04e2dc295c_874fd8ddceb4040b66938673a4c8de44_gdpr_act.webp)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/681e4fa1297a4885d2c3fb17_hipaa-e1638383751916.png)\n\nFeatures\n\nResources\n\nLearn More\n\nSocial\n\nÂ© 2025 HoneyHive Inc.\n\nAll rights reserved'), SearchResult(url='https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1', title='Line Goes Up?

Such rapid progress has led many commentators to argue that LLM general cognitive capabilities have likewise rapidly improved, with the implication that such models are becoming progressively more capable on various real-world tasks. Here I summarise theoretical and empirical considerations to challenge this narrative. I argue that inherent limitations with the benchmarking paradigm, along with specific limitations of existing benchmarks, render benchmark performance highly unsuitable as a metric for generalisable competence over cognitive tasks. I also contend that alternative methods for assessing LLM capabilities, including adversarial stimuli and interpretability techniques, have shown that LLMs do not have robust competence in many language and reasoning tasks, and often fail to learn representations which facilitate generalisable inferences. I conclude that benchmark performance should not be used as a reliable indicator of general LLM cognitive capabilities.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n_K_ eywords Benchmarking ⋅⋅\\cdot⋅ Large language models ⋅⋅\\cdot⋅ Artificial intelligence ⋅⋅\\cdot⋅ Interpretability\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n1 Introduction\n--------------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nThe recent development of large language models (LLMs)1 1 1 A note on terminology. In this article I use the term ‘large language models’ (LLMs) to refer to models based on the transformer architecture trained on large corpus of text data to interact with the user via natural language. Examples of such models include the Llama series, the GPT series, and the Gemini series. Although these models are capable of tasks beyond language processing, such as mathematical and coding tasks, this is still performed by next token prediction after training on linear strings of text. I avoid the term ‘artificial intelligence’, as it has no accepted clear meaning and does not refer to any specific model architecture. based on the transformer architecture has led to extensive discussion as to how to best measure their capabilities. The most common way to assess LLMs is by their performance on standardised tests called benchmarks. It is often argued that recent substantial improvements in LLM benchmark scores, largely driven by state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4 and OpenAI’s o3, are indicative of large increases in the capability of LLMs. On this basis, it is often inferred that such models are becoming significantly more capable, potentially outstripping human-level performance, on a wide range of real-world tasks. In this article I contend that this argument is flawed in two key respects. First, I argue that inherent limitations with the benchmarking paradigm, along with specific limitations of existing benchmarks, combine to render benchmark performance highly unsuitable as a metric for generalisable competence across a range of tasks. Second, I argue that an alternative set of methods more suited for investigating the robustness and generalisability of LLM capabilities, namely adversarial stimuli and interpretability techniques, has yielded strong evidence that LLMs do not have robust competence in many language and reasoning tasks, and often fail to learn representations which facilitate generalisable inferences.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n2 Problems with benchmarks\n--------------------------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nA benchmark is a test designed to assess the ability of an LLM to perform a particular type of task. They are designed to interrogate the ability of LLMs to perform tasks such as grammatical judgements, commonsense reasoning, logical inference, answering science or math questions, and producing computer code. Hundreds of benchmarks have been developed over the past decade, and it is outside my scope to review them here. Interested readers can consult existing literature reviews [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib1), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib2), [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib3)]. Here my purpose is to highlight several major limitations inherent in the practise of using benchmarks to assess the real-world capabilities and competence of LLMs, along with specific limitations of existing popular benchmarks. Critically, benchmarks aim to assess LLM capabilities in performing certain types of tasks that are similar, but not identical, to those contained in the benchmark itself. A high benchmark score is therefore not meaningful unless we have reason to believe the benchmark provides a good estimate for performance on related real-world tasks. In this section, however, I will argue that this is rarely the case.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n### 2.1 Over-fitting to the benchmarks\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nA major problem with many benchmarks is that shortly after they are made publicly available, they become incorporated into the data used to train the very LLMs they are intended to assess. Modern LLMs are easily large enough to memorise large swaths of data, with numerous studies finding evidence of benchmark tasks having been learned during model pre-training or subsequent fine-tuning [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib4), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib5), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib6)]. Further, even if LLMs do not directly memorise the answers to a task, exposing LLMs to example problems from a specific benchmark allows them to learn statistical regularities associated with that task. This can allow the LLM to achieve a higher score on that benchmark without any actual improvement in the LLM’s general reasoning capabilities [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib4)].\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nMore broadly, the development of LLMs has become guided by benchmark performance to the extent that the benchmarks lose much of their value in assessing LLM capabilities. This problem is an instance of Goodhart’s law, the adage that “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure”. Initially presented in the context of economics, it also applies in the context of evaluating LLMs [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib7), [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib8)]. Unfortunately, its importance in this context often goes unappreciated. For instance, recently the World Economic Forum erroneously inferred that LLMs have exceeded human performance on various cognitive tasks, on the basis that LLMs have exceeded human performance on benchmarks designed to test those task [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib9)]. Such an inference is only valid if the benchmarks in question are unbiased and representative indicators of LLM performance for the corresponding task as a whole. This measurement function of benchmarks, however, has been supplanted by their use as targets. New LLMs are designed specifically to achieve ‘state-of-the-art performance’ on various benchmarks, with this being rewarded by conference papers, citations, and media attention. Such incentives result in model architectures, parameters, and training regimes being fitted specifically to these benchmarks, thereby reducing their relevance for assessing LLM performance [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib10)]. Such over-fitting to the test is manifested in the rapid pace with which new benchmarks become saturated, even while fundamental limitations of LLM competence are still evident, thereby requiring still newer benchmarks to assess performance [[11](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib11), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib7)].\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nSimilar problems have long been appreciated in the field of psychometrics [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib12)]. When people practise or receive coaching on components of an IQ test, performance on that task improves [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib13)], but the test become less predictive of subsequent performance on other tasks [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib14)]. This phenomenon results in recommendations to limit the number of times a given test is assigned to a particular individual. The problem is likely to be even worse in the case of LLMs, as compared to humans they can be much more thoroughly adapted to specific tasks through architectural design choices, hyperparameter selection, choice of training data, and fine-tuning paradigm. This further highlights the difficulty of using benchmarks as both research targets and as evaluation metrics.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nSupplementing these theoretical concerns, several recent studies have analysed this phenomenon empirically. One study found that fine-tuning various LLMs on the training portion of question answering and text comprehension datasets resulted in a doubling of performance. They also found that fine-tuning on some benchmarks led to a decline in performance on other benchmarks [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib15)]. Another study found that leading LLMs such as GPT-4 had been exposed to many commonly-used public machine learning datasets in its training data. Indeed, in five out of seven cases GPT-4 had learned the data sufficiently well to be able to accurately sample from the dataset and reconstruct conditional distributions. These results highlight the difficulty of assessing LLMs using benchmarks which were publicly known at the time of their development [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib16)].\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n### 2.2 Relevance of benchmark tasks\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nAnother significant problem with existing LLM benchmarks is the lack of research concerning their behavioural relevance. Few benchmarks provide substantive theoretical justification concerning how or why certain tasks were selected, or empirical evidence that strong performance on the benchmark correlates with performance on tasks of real-world relevance. While psychometrics has grappled with these questions for decades and developed sophisticated (though still imperfect) methods for addressing them, theoretical and empirical evaluation of LLM benchmarks lags far behind [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib17), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib11)]. Too often, it is simply assumed that if a task requires intelligence for a human to perform then it will also be useful as a measure of the cognitive capabilities of an LLM. Decades of artificial intelligence research, however, has found that many tasks which require intelligence and flexible cognitive capabilities for humans to perform can nonetheless be accomplished by artificial systems that are not intelligent and lack general cognitive capabilities. Examples of this phenomenon, sometimes called Moravec’s paradox [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib18)], include executing search and sorting algorithms, automated theorem proving, playing games like chess and Go, competing in jeopardy, and many natural language tasks. Given the lack of careful research and poor track record of prediction, there is good reason to be skeptical about how informative current LLM benchmarks are about generalisable cognitive capabilities.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nSurvey evidence from users and developers of LLMs highlights this gap between benchmarks and real-world applications. Recently a series of interviews was conducted with 19 policy analysts, academic researchers, and industry professionals who have used benchmarks to inform decisions regarding adoption or development of LLMs [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib19)]. Most respondents were skeptical of the relevance of benchmark performance for real-world tasks, as they found it difficult to relate questions on the benchmarks to tasks of real-world relevance or customer requirements. One especially blunt respondent reported: ‘Some of the major benchmarks that people use today, MMLU, for example, (if you) just go through the questions and look at them, and you’ll realize that they are awful… a bunch of totally irrelevant stuff, things that are totally wrong.’\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nAn additional factor limiting real-world applicability is that many benchmarks suffer from poor quality control and inadequate documentation of procedures for assessing accuracy of data. For example, one analysis found that 30% of Google’s emotion dataset is mislabelled [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib20)]. An analysis of NLI benchmarks similarly found that many of the questions either had incorrect answers or were too vague to have a single objective solution [[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib21)]. Similar problems have been documented for the MMLU benchmark [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib22)]. Furthermore, multiple prompts taken from a single benchmark commonly exhibit highly correlated performance across different LLMs, driven in part by semantic similarity between prompts. This indicates that benchmarks do not provide random sampling of problem types, which increases the risk that over-fitting to the benchmark will result in failure of generalisation [[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib23)]. Overall, quality control is clearly on ongoing challenge for LLM benchmarks.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n### 2.3 Analysis of recent benchmarks\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nIn an effort to rectify some of these problems, recently several new benchmarks have been developed which aim to provide a more rigorous test of LLM capabilities. Several of these benchmarks have recently attracted attention due to OpenAI’s new reasoning models o1 and o3 achieving substantial performance gains on these tasks. Here I consider several of these newer benchmarks in more detail, discussing the extent to which they successfully resolve the problems highlighted above.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nSciEval is a benchmark consisting of 18,000 questions covering physics, chemistry, and biology, which utilises dynamically generated data to reduce the problem of contamination of training data [[24](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib24)]. This dynamic component of the benchmark highlights just how extensive data contamination is, with GPT4’s accuracy on physics questions of falling from 65% on publicly available static data to 26% on dynamic data. While the use of dynamic data is a step forward, it is likely to be insufficient to resolve the problem of data contamination, since LLMs can learn not only the precise numerical values but also the form and structure of the questions [[25](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib25)]. This so-called task contamination has been found to be responsible for about a 20 percentage point increase in performance of the GPT-3 series models when comparing older to newer benchmarks.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nThe GPQA benchmark consists of multiple-choice questions covering chemistry, physics, and biology which are said to be ‘Google-proof’ [[26](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib26)]. This claim is based on the fact that performance of non-experts on the questions only marginally increased when they were given access to the internet. The questions are also claimed to be difficult, as domain experts achieved 65% accuracy compared to a mere 34% (on a 25% baseline) achieved by non-experts with unrestricted internet access. However, the authors also found that LLMs achieved about the same score on the most difficult subset of questions as on the easier subset of questions, which contrasted sharply with the observation that human experts performed four times as well as non-experts on the difficult questions compared to only twice as well on the easier questions. This discrepancy indicates that LLMs are likely performing the task in a different manner to humans, raising the question as to whether they have truly obtained generalisable competence in the relevant subjects, or instead are relying on superficial heuristics to answer questions.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nThe FrontierMath benchmark is comprised of novel math problems developed specifically for the purpose by domain experts [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib27)]. To prevent contamination of training data, it has not been made publicly available. While these are important steps forward, the authors still fall prey to the common mistake of assuming without evidence that their benchmark succeeds in testing the construct it was designed to test. Specifically, they claim that “the problems in FrontierMath demand deep theoretical understanding, creative insight, and specialized expertise”. While the novel math problems may well require deep theoretical insight for humans to solve, it is an entirely open question whether they require equivalent understanding or insight for LLMs to solve. This is especially relevant given that all tasks on the benchmark have numerical answers, meaning that correct reasoning is not assessed, only the solution. As such, it is unclear whether this benchmark will do much better than ensuring that models which achieve high scores have genuine mathematical competence, instead of merely utilising complex but superficial heuristics for guessing the answers.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nRE-Bench consists of seven machine learning assignments where performance is evaluated using metrics such as the accuracy or efficiency of the resulting code [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib28)]. Unlike most other benchmarks, RE-Bench requires the LLM to generate workable code, rather than simply output a multiple-choice option or numerical answer. While undoubtedly a useful resource, this benchmark does not live up to its claim of testing the capabilities of LLMs to serve as ‘AI researchers’, as it only assesses their ability to perform modestly-sized, clearly-defined, non-interacting coding tasks. Another major limitation is that while producing their answers, LLMs and humans were both able to submit preliminary solutions and receive scores on a test set as live feedback. While the 8-hour time limit meant that it was difficult for humans to make much use of this information, the LLMs were able to quickly iterate many slightly different solutions to effectively brute-force increased scores against the test set. The authors also note that several times LLMs failed to adhere to the task instructions, which led them to produce solutions which performed well on the automated performance evaluation but were manually marked as incorrect for not adhering to the task. This raises the question of how often LLMs are able to achieve nominally correct answers despite following incorrect reasoning processes on other benchmarks where such manual inspection is not possible.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nOverall, while these novel benchmarks represent a step forward for evaluation of LLMs, I conclude that they have failed to mitigate the major problems of data contamination, lack of real-world relevance, and poor evidence for generalisability that have plagued previous LLM benchmarks.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n3 Generalisation abilities of LLMs\n----------------------------------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nThe purpose of benchmarks is to provide metrics of LLM performance which generalise beyond the specific questions contained in the benchmark to a range of tasks of real-world relevance. There are several aspects of successful generalisation, including performance of tasks from outside the training distribution [[29](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib29)], ability to combine previously learned components in novel ways (compositionality) [[30](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib30)], and robustness to task alternations such as noise, changes in format, and irrelevant information [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib31)]. In the previous section I argued that current benchmarks are poorly suited for the purpose of measuring generalisable LLM performance on cognitive tasks. In this section I argue that we have strong evidence from adversarial, interpretability, and capability research that current LLMs are unable to learn to perform many cognitive tasks in a robust and consistent manner.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n### 3.1 Adversarial stimuli and tasks\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nOne useful technique for interrogating the capabilities of LLMs is to develop tasks or stimuli which are deliberately designed to be challenging for them. Such adversarial tasks are analogous to tasks developed in the heuristics and biases literature to study the limitations of human cognition [[32](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib32)]. In this section I highlight several recent studies which have bearing on the question of how well LLMs are able to learn to generalise beyond the problems they were trained on.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nIn one study focused on automated evaluation of LLMs, researchers developed a simple adversarial model which always produced the same output in response to all instructions [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib33)]. However, this adversarial model was cleverly designed to reliably fool automated LLM evaluation software by manipulating the format of its output. This technique was able to fool even advanced evaluation models like GPT-4 about 80% of the time. The inability to detect or appropriately respond to what humans would easily recognise as an obvious attempt to circumvent the test highlights the lack of any human-level understanding of the input. Such fragility also indicates that robust generalisation to novel styles and formatting of responses is likely to be difficult.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nOther studies have used reversed text as an adversarial stimulus. This is motivated by the idea that if LLMs learn generalisable language competence analogous to that possessed by humans, they should show much greater competencies when trained on forward compared to reversed text. One prominent example relates to a widely publicised study which found that LLMs performed better than human experts at predicting the outcomes of neuroscience studies based only on their abstract [[34](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib34)]. A follow-up study replicated this effect with models trained on character-reversed neuroscience articles, even showing slightly better performance than models trained on regular text. These results indicate that LLMs do not perform the task by extracting the same sorts of features that humans use in assessing the content of a scientific article [[35](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib35)]. Sensitivity to stimulus structure has also been investigated at the syntax level, with one study finding that ChatGPT performs better than humans at judging grammatical sentences, but when asked about ungrammatical sentences only achieves about 35% accuracy compared to humans 75% [[36](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib36)]. ChatGPT also tends to oscillate between answers even when given the same question much more than humans.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nAdversarial methods have also been used to present LLMs with subtle variations of a task designed to elicit mistakes for models which inadequately process semantic content. One study focusing on theory of mind tasks found that GPT-4 performed very inconsistently on false-belief tasks [[37](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib37)]. On two of five task variants, GPT-4 achieved zero percent accuracy, while achieving nearly 100% accuracy on slightly different forms of the task. The model seemed to be easily distracted by irrelevant details or make false inferences based on which information was included . Similar findings have been observed when evaluating ChatGPT on arithmetic problems, where performance degraded by 70% when irrelevant information was included in the prompt [[38](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib38)].\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nOther studies have also found results indicating that LLMs fail to adequately represent the meaning of their prompts. An analysis of ChatGPT found that its answers to various questions about world facts or sentence meaning changed between 20% and 40% of the time when questions were paraphrased or reworded slightly [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib39)]. Similarly, an analysis of BERT models on NLI tasks showed that the models relied mostly on superficial heuristics such as presence of words like ‘all’ or ‘some’ in the premises, with performance breaking down on the subset of problems where such heuristics could not be used [[40](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib40)]. These results indicate that LLMs do not truly understand the meaning of the language they process in the way a human would, raising questions about the ability to reliably generalise to unseen examples or novel domains.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n### 3.2 Failure to learn problem structure\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nWhile LLMs perform well on simple instances of logical and mathematical problems, they often fail with more complex problems even when the basic steps are the same in both cases. While humans can make errors of execution due to working memory constraints or lapses of attention, LLMs fail for very different reasons. Specifically, evidence indicates that LLMs learn superficial heuristics from extensive training data while failing to learn the underlying structure of the problem or the steps needed to solve it. Memorisation of single steps observed in the training data is common, with relatively poor ability to combine multiple steps together [[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib41)]. Various research has found that LLMs systematically fail to learn robust representations of problem structure in ways that allow them to appropriately generalise to alterations of the problem or stimulus.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nLLMs are often highly sensitive to the order of answers and specific symbols used to present them. For example, one study found changes in accuracy of up to 25 percentage points depending on which order multiple choice answers were presented in [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib10)]. Changing the symbols from letters to unusual characters reduced accuracies by around 5 percentage points on average. Large reductions in accuracy of 20-30 percentage points were also observed across a range of models when they were provided with irrelevant incorrect answers along with the question prompt. Another study found that the performance of Llama3 on the MMLU task fell by about 25 percentage points when model was prompted to provide its answers in a slightly different way [[42](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib42)].\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nAnalysis of mathematical tasks has also found that LLMs consistently fail to learn the underlying task structure. One study used GSM-Symbolic, a maths benchmark which consisting of variants of a standard set of arithmetic questions produced by altering variable names and values [[43](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib43)]. The authors found that these simple changes reduced performance by 1-9 percentage points, indicating some degree of over-fitting to the existing static dataset. They also found that including superficially important but ultimately irrelevant information reduced accuracies by up to 65 percentage points, with even o1-preview experiencing a reduction of 17 percentage points. A similar effect was observed in a separate analysis of GPT-4, where performance on a logical inference problem declined from over 95% to about 40% when irrelevant rules were introduced and the order of the premises was altered [[44](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib44)]. Such sensitivity to the alteration of variable names and inclusion of irrelevant information is not expected of a system which has adequately learned how to interpret and solve arithmetic problems.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nChain-of-thought prompting, a technique designed to help LLMs reason more carefully about complex problems, often increases LLM performance without improving generalisable reasoning capabilities. One analysis of such prompts found that for seven of the eight tasks examined, inserting a mistake near the beginning of the chain-of-thought resulted in the same answer being given more than 60% of the time [[45](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib45)]. This indicates that much of the ‘thought’ contains post-hoc rationalisation rather than genuine reasoning. Interestingly, the authors also found this degree of post hoc reasoning was greater for larger models than smaller ones. Another analysis found that when chain-of-thought prompting was used to train the Llama model to perform an arithmetic task, performance increased from 79% to 95% [[46](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib46)]. However, when an informative task-relevant prompt was replaced by a series of meaningless filler tokens, performance only fell to 94%, indicating that the content of the prompt was not relevant to the improved performance. Another analysis focusing on use of chain-of-thought prompting for planning found that LLMs consistently failed to generalise appropriately to new problem instances, and only performed well when given prompts highly specific and tailored to each type of problem [[47](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib47)].\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nOne especially insightful study used a careful series of analyses to illustrate how LLMs can fail to learn the underlying structure of a task despite achieving high performance on test sets [[29](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib29)]. In a series of experiments the authors showed that the BERT model could achieve near perfect performance on a logical deduction task when tested on a subset of problems sampled in the same way as the problems on which it was trained. However, if different sampling algorithms were instead used to generate the training and testing data, performance dropped significantly, falling close to chance levels for more difficult problems. This decline in performance occurred even though both algorithms sampled from the same space of problems, with the only difference being that they did so using slightly different techniques too subtle for humans to discern any overall differences between the resulting two sets of problems. The authors also identified statistical artefacts in the training distribution, which they showed BERT had utilised to accurately perform the task when tested on data sampled in the same way as the data on which it was trained. These statistical artefacts, however, were not present when the problems were sampled in a different way, resulting in incorrect predictions when BERT asked to generalise beyond its training problems. Since such statistical artefacts are inevitable in any sample of instances of a sufficiently complex problem, it is infeasible to identify and remove all of them. This is especially significant since contemporary LLMs are so large that they can identify and utilise very complex and abstract statistical associations that may be impossible for humans to even understand. This study therefore powerfully highlights the inherent limits of the entirely statistical methods by which LLMs learn to solve abstract problems, and the difficulties in ensuring such performance will generalise to real world problems.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n### 3.3 The promise of reasoning models\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nThe past year has seen the emergence of ‘reasoning models’ such as OpenAI’s o1 and o3, DeepSeek-R1, or Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model. While little information about their architecture or training has been made public, these models are evidently LLMs with extensive fine-tuning on step-by-step reasoning problems taken from domains such as mathematics, coding, and science [[48](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib48)]. The models are then trained to generate a large number of candidate solutions and then score each using heuristics learned from their training data. Some have claimed that such models represent a new paradigm that will resolve the problems and limitations with traditional LLMs [[49](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib49), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib50)]. Currently, these systems are too recent for any significant evaluation of their capabilities to have been published. However, there are powerful reasons to doubt the claim that reasoning models have circumvented the problems with benchmarking and generalisation discussed in previous sections.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, it is unclear why additional fine-tuning on step-by-step reasoning would substantially mitigate LLM limitations with generalisation or learning problem structure. As noted, reasoning models appear to work by generating large numbers of candidate chain-of-thought solutions and then using a heuristic function trained by reinforcement learning to select the most plausible candidates. Insofar as this outline is accurate, ‘reasoning models’ are not performing genuine reasoning, but are learning to mimic desired outputs by utilising heuristics and complex statistical regularities. While it may be more effective to learn to match steps in the reasoning process rather than directly predicting the final answer, the system still lacks any evident mechanism for ensuring that it learns the underlying structure of the problem rather than complex but ultimately superficial or irrelevant statistical regularities. True formal reasoning requires structural modelling of a program and performing specified operations on the component elements of the problem until the desired endpoint is reached. Based on information at the time of writing, reasoning models appear instead to be matching and mimicking reasoning steps contained in their enormous training corpus, and combining them together in accordance with complex heuristics derived from reinforcement learning. This strategy may yield performance improvements for certain types of problems, but does not resolve the key issue of the inability to learn underlying problem structure so as to facilitate robust generalisable inferences.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nIt has been argued that reasoning models have the potential to generate massively new training datasets that will allow for rapid improvements in performance. Specifically, the claim is that fine-tuning on step-by-step programming or mathematical reasoning tasks will enable the automatic generation of large new datasets of reasoning steps, which can then be combined with answers automatically checked for correctness [[50](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib50)]. This new data can then be fed back into the model to provide even more training data, thereby further improving performance in a virtuous feedback cycle. While this approach may work in certain cases, the methodology assumes that the reasoning steps generated by model are correct and logically lead to the generated answer. This is not something that can be easily checked, and it is also inconsistent with research which indicates that chain-of-thought prompts often improve performance even while consisting largely of post-hoc reasoning that does not logically entail the generated answer [[45](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib45), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib47)]. The core problem is therefore left unsolved, namely of ensuring that the model learns the underlying logical structure of the problem and can apply this knowledge to relevant novel instances, instead of relying on superficial heuristics which will not robustly generalise to most real-world applications.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nBeyond these general theoretical concerns, there are specific reasons to be cautious about the claims made about the capabilities of reasoning models. Announcements by companies like OpenAI concerning the benchmark performance of newly developed models should be interpreted as marketing designed to appeal to potential customers and investors, rather than as research reports having substantial scientific value. Too often, commentators accept such announcements entirely at face value as evidence of substantial progress, with no discussion of the extent to which such results will be reproducible, generalisable, or robust. Furthermore, in achieving these benchmarks OpenAI and other companies are likely to be making full use of any publicly available training portions of existing benchmarks. They may even be developing internal datasets with tasks resembling those from known benchmarks to use for training, thereby allowing for improved performance on those specific benchmarks which may not generalise to other tasks.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nSeveral recent examples highlight these concerns. Recently it emerged that OpenAI was one of the major funders of the FrontierMath benchmark, and had at least some of the solutions in their possession [[51](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib51)]. Exactly how these were used in the development of o3 is unclear, however there is more than enough reason to be suspicious about performance claims made regarding this benchmark. In addition, o3 was also trained on the public data of ARC-AI, a dataset comprised of abstract visual reasoning problems in the style of Raven’s progressive matrices [[52](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib52)]. When combined with the large amount of targeted research this benchmark has attracted in recent years, the high scores achieved by o3 should not be considered a reliable metric of general reasoning capabilities. Most recently, OpenAI has claimed that o3 achieved substantially improved performance on the CodeForces benchmark and International Olympiad in Informatics 2024 competition [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib53)]. While the questions from these evaluations had already been made public by the time they were used for assessing o3, OpenAI claims their training cutoff was after the release of these problems, and that manual search revealed no evidence of contamination of the training data. They also claimed that the performance increase was due entirely to reinforcement learning of step-by-step reasoning, with no specific tailoring to the specific benchmarks. Though at present these claims are impossible to verify, even if taken at face value, information from the benchmarks could still have influenced the development of o3 through selection of hyperparameters or other development decisions. As an illustration of how this can occur, one study using older LLMs illustrated how information from a test dataset can be ‘illicitly’ learned by a series of seemingly benign intermediate evaluation steps [[54](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib54)]. As such, until OpenAI’s claims can be independently verified using novel problems, it should not be assumed that the claimed improvements in benchmark scores will translate into an equivalently large and robust improvement in generalised capabilities.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nIn the case of the recently-released DeepSeek-R1, although more information is available than for OpenAI’s o3 model, it is still highly unclear what data was used for training [[48](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14318v1#bib.bib48)]. The authors mention a combination of synthetic and human-annotated data used for both chain-of-thought fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, but no details are provided as to the nature of the data or what types of tasks were trained on. It is rumoured that it was trained on outputs generated by OpenAI’s o1 model, which calls into question how generalisable its reasoning capabilities really are when applied to novel types of problems not reflected in its training data. DeepSeek-R1 has been made publicly available, which should facilitate community analysis of the robustness of its general reasoning cognitive capabilities.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nOverall, there are strong theoretical and empirical reasons to doubt that AI reasoning models have substantially resolved the limitations of previous generations of LLMs. New models like o3 still rely on the same underlying mechanisms that extract superficial heuristics from huge datasets without learning the structure of a problem. Likewise, state-of-the-art scores on benchmarks which were already known and likely guided o3’s development are not a reliable indicator of its capabilities of genuine reasoning or generalisation to novel tasks.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nIt is undeniable that recent years have seen substantial progress in the development of large language models capable of performing many tasks relating to language, logic, coding, and mathematics. However, the extent of this progress is frequently exaggerated based on appeals to rapid increases in performance on various benchmarks. I have argued that these benchmarks are of limited value for measuring LLM progress because of problems of models being over-fit to the benchmarks, lack real-world relevance of test items, and inadequate validation for whether the benchmarks predict general cognitive performance. Conversely, evidence from adversarial tasks and interpretability research indicates that LLMs consistently fail to learn the underlying structure of the tasks they are trained on, instead relying on complex statistical associations and heuristics which enable good performance on test benchmarks but generalise poorly to many real-world tasks. The result is that the LLMs lack robust reasoning capabilities that are consistent and invariant to irrelevant changes in problem format, style, numerical data, or context. Despite much recent hype, new reasoning models do not offer a general solution to these problems. Renewed hype highlights the importance of subjecting new LLMs to careful systematic evaluation to determine its reasoning capabilities and their limits across a range of scenarios. Benchmark performance alone is insufficient to establish general reasoning competence.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n*   [1]↑ Yupeng Chang, Xu Wang, Jindong Wang, Yuan Wu, Linyi Yang, Kaijie Zhu, Hao Chen, Xiaoyuan Yi, Cunxiang Wang, Yidong Wang, et al.

We introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via a parametric transformation and detects overfitting of LLMs. By rephrasing inputs while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes whether a model’s performance is driven by memorized patterns. Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our method reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant differences. Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger performance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy show insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. Moreover, C-BOD’s dataset- and model-agnostic design allows easy integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding. Our findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nForget What You Know about LLMs Evaluations - LLMs are Like a Chameleon\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nNurit Cohen-Inger 1, Yehonatan Elisha 2, Bracha Shapira 1, Lior Rokach 1, Seffi Cohen 1 1 Ben Gurion University 2 Tel Aviv University\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n1 Introduction\n--------------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on a wide range of NLP tasks Chang et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib9)). Consequently, hundreds of benchmarks have been established to track progress and evaluate model capabilities Lu et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib20)); Liang et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib19)). However, the rapid proliferation of LLMs and the frequent use of public leaderboards raise concerns about the robustness of these evaluation practices Castillo-Bolado et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib8)). Specifically, as benchmark data becomes more widely recognized, models may learn to exploit surface patterns or spurious correlations, rather than exhibit genuine language understanding. This issue can lead to deceptively high scores that do not reflect true progress.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nIn this paper, we examine whether LLMs rely excessively on benchmark-specific cues potentially overfitting to the patterns inherent in widely published evaluation benchmarks and explore systematic methods to detect and mitigate this behavior. In other words, are LLMs prone to overfitting on popular benchmarks, and what underlying factors contribute to this phenomenon?\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nTo answer this question, we introduce Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a framework that reveals how heavily a model depends on the exact wording or structure of a test set. By introducing controlled textual distortions to benchmark prompts at varying intensities (defined by a distortion parameter μ 𝜇\\mu italic_μ), as demonstrated in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Forget What You Know about LLMs Evaluations - LLMs are Like a Chameleon"), our method reveals whether high performance is built on superficial patterns. Notably, our framework requires only the evaluation set, without accessing the model’s training data or architecture. Unlike conventional leaderboards that solely track performance, our meta-evaluation framework acts as a safeguard ensuring that high scores do not stem from superficial memorization of benchmark cues.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n![Image 3: Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1/extracted/6195080/motivation.png)\n\nFigure 1: An example demonstrating the C-BOD method. The original question (top) is perturbed (bottom) while preserving the semantic meaning and correct answer options. The model correctly answers the original question but fails on the perturbed version, suggesting potential overfitting. Changes in the perturbed question are highlighted in bold.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n#### Our Contributions:\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n1.   1.Robust Overfitting Detection with Statistical Significance. Our framework computes the performance difference Δ μ subscript Δ 𝜇\\Delta_{\\mu}roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT between original and perturbed prompts and confirms its statistical significance, ensuring that observed differences indeed indicate overfitting rather than chance variations.\n\nReport issue for preceding element \n2.   2.New Findings For LLM Community Our extensive analysis reveals new trends regarding how LLMs function with respect to their number of parameters and baseline performance.\n\nReport issue for preceding element \n3.   3.Extensive Empirical Validation. We apply our method to multiple LLM families of various architectures and parameter sizes. Even modest textual distortions cause significant performance differences in most models, providing strong empirical evidence that overfitting is widespread.\n\nReport issue for preceding element \n4.   4.Publicly Available Benchmarks and Code. We release rephrased versions of the widely used MMLU evaluation set under different distortion levels (μ 𝜇\\mu italic_μ). These resources enable the community to adopt more robust, surface-invariant tests for reliable LLM assessment with our method reproducible code.\n\nReport issue for preceding element \n5.   5.Blueprint for Iterative Overfit Mitigation. Beyond detection, these μ 𝜇\\mu italic_μ-based rephrasings can be integrated into model training or fine-tuning pipelines. Regularly exposing models to diverse prompt variations helps reduce reliance on benchmark-specific phrasing, thus promoting more generalizable language understanding.\n\nReport issue for preceding element \n\n2 Related Work\n--------------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n### 2.1 Benchmark Evaluation and Overfitting\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nLLMs have achieved impressive results on many benchmarks. This success has driven the development of comprehensive evaluation suites such as BIG-Bench Srivastava et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib25)) and HELM Liang et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib19)). MMLU benchmark set Hendrycks et al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib13)) evaluates question answering across 57 subjects—including STEM, humanities, and social sciences, while Zhang et al. ([2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib33)) introduced 25 enterprise-focused datasets covering domains like finance, legal, cybersecurity, and climate sustainability for tasks such as classification, NER, and summarization. Another recent resource, JUDGE-BENCH Bavaresco et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib3)), comprises 20 NLP datasets that assess models against human judgments. We focus on MMLU because of its widespread adoption and comprehensive domain coverage Wang et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib27)), which makes it particularly effective for exposing overfitting to canonical prompt structures.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nWhile these benchmarks have been critical for comparing new models’ versions, recent studies warn that publicly released evaluation sets can become less reliable over time due to overexposure and memorization Yu et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib32)); Chang et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib9)). In some cases, LLMs learn superficial patterns specific to well-known datasets, boosting performance without reflecting genuine semantic or conceptual understanding. Kiela et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib15)) further emphasize the need for continuously refreshing benchmarks to ensure real progress in language understanding. For example, OpenAI’s GPT models have shown steady improvement on MMLU: GPT-3 achieved approximately 43% accuracy in 2020 Brown et al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib6)), rising to nearly 70% with GPT-3.5 in 2022 1 1 1[https://cdn.openai.com/papers/GPT-4-Technical-Report.pdf](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/GPT-4-Technical-Report.pdf), and reaching 86% with GPT-4 in 2023 2 2 2[https://cdn.openai.com/papers/GPT-4-Technical-Report.pdf](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/GPT-4-Technical-Report.pdf).\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nMemorization in LLMs has been widely studied Kiyomaru et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib16)); Biderman et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib5)), with larger models especially prone to retaining training data verbatim Carlini et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib7)). This phenomenon can inflate performance metrics while obscuring genuine model capabilities. Moreover, several works highlight training-set contamination, where test samples appear exactly or as near-duplicates in the training data, as another crucial form of overfitting Deng et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib10)); Yao et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib30)), leading to overly optimistic performance estimates Yang et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib29)).\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n### 2.2 Gap in Current Work\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nResearchers have introduced various methods to detect or mitigate training contamination: Finding the N-gram overlap (e.g., 13-grams or 50-character matches) between training and test data Brown et al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib6)); OpenAI ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib22)), though it can miss semantically equivalent rephrasing. Embedding similarity search Reimers ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib23)) that uses transformer-based embeddings to identify semantically close training-test pairs Lee et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib17)). Decoding Matching probes the model by providing partial test prompts and measuring how likely it is to complete them exactly Li ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib18)) or completing missing words Deng et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib10)). A recent study presented an overfit detection of editing knowledge to a LLM Zhang et al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib35)).\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nAlthough these studies have focused on detecting training data contamination or focusing on additional knowledge, they lack with addressing a critical issue: overfitting to benchmark-specific artifacts. In many cases, LLMs may never see the test data during training yet still learn to rely on superficial cues unique to a benchmark’s canonical format. Existing techniques such as n-gram overlap and embedding similarity fail to capture this subtle form of overfitting. In contrast, our approach explicitly quantifies the dependence of a model’s performance on the precise phrasing and structure of evaluation prompts, thereby filling this gap in current evaluation methodologies. By systematically applying a controllable distortion parameter to evaluation prompts, without requiring additional training or access to training data, our method shows how performance metrics degrade under textual perturbations, providing a robust means of diagnosing and mitigating broader overfitting behavior.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n3 Method\n--------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nLet 𝒟 𝒟\\mathcal{D}caligraphic_D denote a benchmark dataset with N samples, and ℰ ℰ\\mathcal{E}caligraphic_E a LLM to be evaluated with respect to a given performance function ℳ ℳ\\mathcal{M}caligraphic_M. Our goal is to detect whether ℰ ℰ\\mathcal{E}caligraphic_E exhibits overfitting to 𝒟 𝒟\\mathcal{D}caligraphic_D. Figure[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#S3.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 3 Method ‣ Forget What You Know about LLMs Evaluations - LLMs are Like a Chameleon") provides an overview of our proposed method, Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD). C-BOD employs a rephrasing transformation to generate a perturbed dataset from 𝒟 𝒟\\mathcal{D}caligraphic_D, evaluates on both the original and perturbed datasets, and applies a statistical test to assess whether performance discrepancies indicate overfitting. The following subsections detail each component of C-BOD.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n![Image 4: Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1/extracted/6195080/MMLU_Eval.png)\n\nFigure 2: High-level pipeline of our parametric approach. The original dataset 𝒟 𝒟\\mathcal{D}caligraphic_D is passed through the distortion operator T μ subscript 𝑇 𝜇 T_{\\mu}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to form 𝒟 μ subscript 𝒟 𝜇\\mathcal{D}_{\\mu}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Both sets are evaluated by a LLM, and differences in performance are used to quantify overfitting.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n### 3.1 C-BOD rephrased dataset generation\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nTo systematically introduce textual variations, C-BOD utilizes a rephrasing tool, denoted as T 𝑇{T}italic_T, which uses as a distortion operator to generate a perturbed dataset 𝒟 μ subscript 𝒟 𝜇\\mathcal{D}_{\\mu}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT from 𝒟 𝒟\\mathcal{D}caligraphic_D. This operator is parameterized by μ 𝜇\\mu italic_μ (temperature), which controls the extent of textual modification, ranging from low (e.g., 0.1 for minimal changes like synonym substitution) to moderate (e.g., 1.0 for rewording and sentence fragment reordering) and high (e.g., 1.5 for aggressive modifications such as question reformulation). We define:\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nT μ:𝒳→𝒳′:subscript 𝑇 𝜇→𝒳 superscript 𝒳′T_{\\mu}:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{X^{\\prime}}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT : caligraphic_X → caligraphic_X start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT\n\nGiven a prompt x i subscript 𝑥 𝑖 x_{i}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, the distortion operator produces a perturbed prompt x i′=T μ\u2062(x i)superscript subscript 𝑥 𝑖′subscript 𝑇 𝜇 subscript 𝑥 𝑖 x_{i}^{\\prime}=T_{\\mu}(x_{i})italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). The perturbed dataset is then constructed as:\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n𝒟 μ={(x i′,y i)|(x i,y i)∈𝒟}subscript 𝒟 𝜇 conditional-set superscript subscript 𝑥 𝑖′subscript 𝑦 𝑖 subscript 𝑥 𝑖 subscript 𝑦 𝑖 𝒟\\mathcal{D}_{\\mu}\\;=\\;\\left\\{\\,\\bigl{(}x_{i}^{\\prime},\\,y_{i}\\bigr{)}\\;\\middle% |\\;(x_{i},y_{i})\\in\\mathcal{D}\\right\\}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = { ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) | ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ∈ caligraphic_D }\n\nAlthough each pair (x i′,y i)superscript subscript 𝑥 𝑖′subscript 𝑦 𝑖(x_{i}^{\\prime},y_{i})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) in the perutbed dataset remains semantically equivalent to (x i,y i)subscript 𝑥 𝑖 subscript 𝑦 𝑖(x_{i},y_{i})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) in the original dataset, the textual variations introduced by T μ subscript 𝑇 𝜇 T_{\\mu}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can disrupt purely memorized mappings from surface patterns to correct labels. This step presented in Lines 5-6 of Algorithm[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#alg1 "Algorithm 1 ‣ 3.3 Statistical Validation ‣ 3 Method ‣ Forget What You Know about LLMs Evaluations - LLMs are Like a Chameleon").\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n### 3.2 Evaluating the Impact of Distortion\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nTo assess the impact of distortion, we evaluate ℰ ℰ\\mathcal{E}caligraphic_E using a performance function, ℳ ℳ\\mathcal{M}caligraphic_M. This function evaluates ℰ ℰ\\mathcal{E}caligraphic_E based on a given ground truth or prompt y i subscript 𝑦 𝑖 y_{i}italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, considering two versions of an input: the original x i∈𝒟 subscript 𝑥 𝑖 𝒟 x_{i}\\in\\mathcal{D}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ caligraphic_D and the perturbed version x i′∈𝒟 μ superscript subscript 𝑥 𝑖′subscript 𝒟 𝜇 x_{i}^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{D}_{\\mu}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∈ caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, where i 𝑖 i italic_i denotes the index of a sample in the dataset. Specifically, ℳ ℳ\\mathcal{M}caligraphic_M is a boolean function that takes as input the model ℰ ℰ\\mathcal{E}caligraphic_E and two data pairs, (x i,y i)subscript 𝑥 𝑖 subscript 𝑦 𝑖(x_{i},y_{i})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and (x i′,y i)superscript subscript 𝑥 𝑖′subscript 𝑦 𝑖(x_{i}^{\\prime},y_{i})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), and returns whether the model performs better on the original input than on the perturbed one. The function is formulated as follows:\n\nReport issue for preceding element\nℳ(ℰ,(x i,y i),(x i′,y i)={1,if\u2062P\u2062(ℰ,x i,y i)>P(ℰ,(x i′,y i),0,otherwise.\\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{E},(x_{i},y_{i}),(x^{\\prime}_{i},y_{i})=\\begin{cases}1,&% \\text{if }P(\\mathcal{E},x_{i},y_{i})\\\\ &\\quad>P(\\mathcal{E},(x^{\\prime}_{i},y_{i}),\\\\ 0,&\\text{otherwise.}\\end{cases}caligraphic_M ( caligraphic_E , ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , ( italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) = { start_ROW start_CELL 1 , end_CELL start_CELL if italic_P ( caligraphic_E , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) end_CELL end_ROW start_ROW start_CELL end_CELL start_CELL > italic_P ( caligraphic_E , ( italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , end_CELL end_ROW start_ROW start_CELL 0 , end_CELL start_CELL otherwise. end_CELL end_ROW\n\nwhere P\u2062(ℰ,x,y)𝑃 ℰ 𝑥 𝑦 P(\\mathcal{E},x,y)italic_P ( caligraphic_E , italic_x , italic_y ) represents the performance score of model ℰ ℰ\\mathcal{E}caligraphic_E on input x 𝑥 x italic_x with reference to ground truth y 𝑦 y italic_y. This formulation is designed to be generalizable across different evaluation metrics and natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. The performance difference between the original set and the perturbed set is then calculated as:\n\nReport issue for preceding element\nΔ μ,b=∑i=0 N ℳ\u2062(ℰ,(x i,y i),(x i′,y i))subscript Δ 𝜇 𝑏 superscript subscript 𝑖 0 𝑁 ℳ ℰ subscript 𝑥 𝑖 subscript 𝑦 𝑖 superscript subscript 𝑥 𝑖′subscript 𝑦 𝑖\\Delta_{\\mu},b=\\sum_{i=0}^{N}\\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{E},(x_{i},y_{i}),(x_{i}^{% \\prime},y_{i}))roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_b = ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i = 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT caligraphic_M ( caligraphic_E , ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) )(1)\n\nThe performance difference between the perturbed set and the original set is then calculated as:\n\nReport issue for preceding element\nc=∑i=0 N ℳ\u2062(ℰ,(x i′,y i),(x i,y i))𝑐 superscript subscript 𝑖 0 𝑁 ℳ ℰ superscript subscript 𝑥 𝑖′subscript 𝑦 𝑖 subscript 𝑥 𝑖 subscript 𝑦 𝑖 c=\\sum_{i=0}^{N}\\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{E},(x_{i}^{\\prime},y_{i}),(x_{i},y_{i}))italic_c = ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i = 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT caligraphic_M ( caligraphic_E , ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) )(2)\n\nA large positive Δ μ subscript Δ 𝜇\\Delta_{\\mu}roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT indicates a significant performance decline due to textual perturbations, suggesting that ℰ ℰ\\mathcal{E}caligraphic_E may be overly reliant on surface-level patterns rather than exhibiting robust generalization. Notably, this approach remains metric-agnostic, making it applicable to a wide range of evaluation measures.

This test evaluates whether the discrepancies between two related sets of classification outcomes, correct and incorrect predictions, are significant.

We detail the benchmark dataset, the procedure for generating perturbed inputs, the LLMs under evaluation, implementation specifics, and the evaluation metrics.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n### 4.1 Dataset and Rephrasing Process\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nOur experiments use the MMLU benchmark Hendrycks et al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#bib.bib13)), which comprises multiple-choice questions spanning 57 subjects. The broad coverage and public availability of MMLU make it an ideal candidate for assessing general knowledge and the degree to which LLMs overfit canonical prompt formats. The MMLU dataset is distributed under the MIT License, which allows for free use, modification, and distribution as long as the original copyright notice and license terms are maintained. We generate a perturbed versions of the original dataset to probe overfitting, following the methodology described in Section[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#S3 "3 Method ‣ Forget What You Know about LLMs Evaluations - LLMs are Like a Chameleon"). We used DeepSeek 3 to create the transformed version of each question. We generate the perturbed dataset using μ=1.0 𝜇 1.0\\mu=1.0 italic_μ = 1.0 (the default temperature parameter).\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nThese perturbations include synonym substitutions, sentence reordering, and the insertion of distractor phrases, while preserving the original semantic meaning and correct answers. Automated formatting checks and manual audits (performed on approximately 10% of the samples) ensure that the integrity of the questions is maintained. For example, an original question:“The coronal suture joins the?” is rephrased as:“Which bones does the coronal suture connect?”. The perturbed dataset, denoted by 𝒟 μ subscript 𝒟 𝜇\\mathcal{D}_{\\mu}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, is released alongside our code for reproducibility 3 3 3[https://github.com/SeffiCohen/CBOD](https://github.com/SeffiCohen/CBOD).\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n### 4.2 Models Under Evaluation\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nTable[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#S4.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 4.2 Models Under Evaluation ‣ 4 Experimental Setting ‣ Forget What You Know about LLMs Evaluations - LLMs are Like a Chameleon") provides an overview of the LLMs evaluated in our experiments.

Notably, the Llama 1B, Llama 3B models maintain relatively stable accuracy, suggesting they are less susceptible to overfitting. We also observed that Falcon 7B, DeepSeek 7B, Qwen 2.5 3B and Jetmoe 8B show statistically insignificant differences, likely due to their lower baseline accuracy. McNemar’s test confirms that the performance declines observed in most models are statistically significant. Notably, no model shows a significant improvement when inputs are rephrased. This indicates that the C-BOD method reliably uncovers model vulnerabilities rather than occasionally yielding unintentional performance gains.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nAcross all evaluated models, the average drop in accuracy was 2.15%, and when considering only the models with statistically significant differences, this drop increased to 2.72%.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nTable 2: Comparison of LLM performance on the original and perturbed MMLU datasets (μ=1.0 𝜇 1.0\\mu=1.0 italic_μ = 1.0).

The examples are from Qwen2.5 (32B parameters).\n\nSubject Original Question Rephrased Question Why the Model Was Wrong?\nProfessional Law“If the defendant is prosecuted for the man’s murder, he will most likely be found…”“If the defendant is charged with the man’s murder, what is the most probable outcome?”In legal contexts, terms like “prosecuted” and “found guilty/not guilty” are tied to specific legal standards. The rephrased question is more open-ended, leading the model to discuss outcomes like plea bargaining instead of focusing on the legal verdict.\nMoral Disputes“Of the following social problems that could result from a genetic supermarket, which does Singer think is the least serious?”“Which of the following social issues arising from a genetic supermarket does Singer consider to be the least concerning?”The word “problems” was changed to “issues,” altering the model’s interpretation. “Issues” can broaden the context of "problems", causing the model to incorrectly interpret which concerns are least serious.\nCollege Chemistry“Which of the following statements is not a reason why tetramethylsilane is used as a 1H chemical shift reference?”“Which of the following statements does not explain why tetramethylsilane is used as a reference for 1H chemical shifts?”The model may have overfit to the structure of the original question, particularly the phrase “is not a reason why,” as it directly signals the correct retrieval path. The rephrased version, with slight syntactic adjustments disrupts this memorization, leading to incorrect retrieval.\nWorld Religions“When did the first Jaina temples appear?.”“At what point in time were the initial Jaina temples established?”The rephrased question shifts key terms (“When” to “At what point in time”), obscuring historical framing. The LLM fails to map this modified phrasing to the original temporal context.\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nThese findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs under varied prompt formulations to ensure that improvements in benchmark performance reflect genuine advances in language understanding rather than overfitting.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n6 Discussion\n------------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n### 6.1 Why Do LLMs Overfit?\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nTable [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07445v1#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 5.3 Relationship Between Model Accuracy and Overfit Detection ‣ 5 Results ‣ Forget What You Know about LLMs Evaluations - LLMs are Like a Chameleon") highlights cases where LLMs answer the original questions correctly but fail on the rephrased versions. The failures suggest potential overfitting, where models overly rely on surface-level cues, memorized patterns, or specific terminologies. Overfitting in this context occurs because the model tends to associate certain question formats or keywords directly with answers instead of generalizing underlying concepts. Common root causes include shifts in terminology, subtle changes in phrasing that alter the semantic scope, and dependence on memorized patterns from training data.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n### 6.2 Forget What You Know About LLM Evaluation\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nIdeally, LLMs should exhibit resilience when faced with variations in prompt wording and structure. In other words, robust LLMs are expected to maintain their performance regardless of how a question is phrased, thereby reflecting true language understanding rather than mere memorization. However, our experiments reveal a contrary trend: models that score highly on standard benchmarks often display heightened sensitivity to even minor alterations in prompt formulation. This behavior suggests that such models have implicitly overfitted to the specific linguistic patterns and structures characteristic of these benchmarks. As a result, when these surface-level cues are modified, performance declines, a phenomenon that underscores the paradox between high benchmark accuracy and genuine generalization.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n#### Agnosticism to Benchmark Set.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nAlthough we used MMLU as a demonstration, our approach is inherently dataset-agnostic. It can be applied to any benchmark by simply adapting the performance metric used to compare the original samples with their rephrased counterparts.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n7 Conclusion\n------------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nIn this paper, we introduced a novel approach for detecting overfit to benchmarks datasets in LLMs by applying parametric transformations to these datasets. Our method revealed that many models rely heavily on surface features of public test sets, leading to significant performance drops when these features are altered. This finding underscores a critical insight: what appears to be robust performance may, in fact, be largely driven by memorization rather than true generalization.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nWe demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach across multiple LLM families. Notably, larger models tend to exhibit more pronounced performance declines under perturbation, while certain models (such as Llama) show greater stability. These observations suggest that training strategies and architectural choices play a significant role in mitigating overfitting, prompting a necessary rethinking of how we evaluate and benchmark LLMs.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nBy providing a practical, dataset-agnostic framework, our work equips the community with a powerful tool to uncover overfitting and to drive the development of benchmarks that better capture genuine generalization. Incorporating these parametric transformations into the evaluation process not only exposes hidden vulnerabilities in current LLMs but also suggests a way for the creation of more resilient models that can adapt to the evolving challenges of language tasks.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\n8 Limitations\n-------------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nWhile C-BOD serves as a promising framework for detecting overfitting in LLMs and has successfully identified overfitting in most evaluated models, it remains subject to several limitations. First, our approach primarily targets textual rephrasings that preserve semantic content. Consequently, it may overlook deeper forms of overfitting, such as factual inaccuracies or logical inconsistencies, which may require more specialized probing techniques. Moreover, incorporating μ 𝜇\\mu italic_μ-based transformations into the training or fine-tuning loop can significantly increase computational cost. Iteratively rephrasing large datasets and retraining with multiple μ 𝜇\\mu italic_μ values imposes a heavy resource burden, which may not be feasible for LLMs or under restricted computational budgets. Future work should investigate more lightweight or partial-integration strategies. In summary, while C-BOD provides an effective means of detecting surface-level overfitting, further advancements are necessary to enhance its efficiency, scalability, and ability to capture more nuanced forms of model overfitting.\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nReport issue for preceding element\n\nWe used ChatGPT-4o for editing the language and refining the presentation of the text in this paper.

As a result, we often cannot rely on the validity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these limited benchmarks.\nThe empirical evidence presented may be biased due to contamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural simplicity.\n\nTo address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new benchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from real-world Python functions.\nULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation process that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case contamination.\nWith 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides a more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs’ test generation capabilities.\nWe also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT with leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization versus reasoning in test generation.\nBased on the two datasets, we conduct a large-scale empirical study involving 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their performance against established benchmarks.\nOur evaluation results demonstrate that ULT is significantly more challenging. For example, test cases generated by LLMs only achieve 41.32%, 45.10%, 30.22%, and 40.21% for accuracy, statement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all LLMs, respectively. These results are substantially lower than the corresponding metrics on TestEval (91.79%, 92.18%, 82.04%, and 49.69%) and PLT (47.07%, 55.13%, 40.07%, and 50.80%).\n\nIn addition, different from existing benchmarks, ULT shows a strong correlation between test generation performance and code generation performance.\nFor example, the correlation coefficient between the coding ability and test generation performance (P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200b1Pass@1italic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ 1) on ULT is 0.79 (p = 0.002), while it is only 0.56 (p = 0.059) and 0.52 (p = 0.080) on TestEval and PLT, respectively.\nThis indicates that ULT more effectively measures the generalization ability of LLMs.\nWe also make ULT and evaluation results publicly available to foster further research111To preserve the integrity of the benchmark and prevent test case leakage into future LLM training sets, we do not release the ground-truth tests. Instead, we provide the complete evaluation results for all models benchmarked in this paper. This allows researchers to compare new models against our findings without compromising the benchmark.. ULT is available at <https://github.com/huangd1999/UnLeakedTestBench>.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nReliable and robust software systems are essential in today’s technology-driven world, where software failures can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and even safety risks.\nEffective software testing is the cornerstone of achieving this reliability, serving as a systematic approach to validate that software behaves as intended under various conditions and to identify defects before deployment ([anand2013orchestrated,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib1) ; [li2017survey,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib2) ).\nAmong the various layers of testing, unit testing holds a particularly critical position ([schafer2023empirical,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib3) ).\nUnit testing involves the creation of specific test inputs designed to scrutinize individual components or “units” of software, typically functions, in isolation.\nThe primary objective of unit test generation is to cover diverse program statements and execution branches ([huang2024rethinking,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib4) ; [wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ; [jain2024testgeneval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib6) ), thereby detecting defects early in the development lifecycle when they are least expensive to fix, and facilitating safer code refactoring and maintenance.\nHowever, despite its importance, the manual composition of comprehensive unit test suites is usually labor-intensive and intellectually demanding.\nExisting research and industry experience consistently highlight the significant manual effort, time investment, and domain expertise traditionally required, making it a frequent bottleneck in agile development environments ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ; [daka2014survey,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib7) ; [yu2025decon,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib8) ).\n\nTo address this challenge and accelerate the unit test generation process, recent research has increasingly explored the application of LLMs in automated test case generation ([chen2022codet,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib9) ; [huang2023codecot,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib10) ; [huang2023agentcoder,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib11) ; [du2024mercury,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib12) ; [shinn2023reflexion,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib13) ; [yang2025kernelgpt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib14) ; [xia2023universal,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib15) ; [deng2024large,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib16) ; [yang2024whitefox,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib17) ).\nWith their advanced capabilities in code understanding and generation, LLMs have shown promise in automating aspects of test case generation.\nFor instance, LLMs have been employed to generate syntactically and semantically valid inputs for fuzzing Deep Learning (DL) libraries by implicitly learning complex API constraints (e.g., TitanFuzz ([deng2023large,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib18) )), and further refined to synthesize unusual programs by leveraging historical bug data (e.g., FuzzGPT ([deng2023fuzzgpt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib19) )).\nOther applications include synthesizing syscall specifications for kernel fuzzing (e.g., KernelGPT ([yang2025kernelgpt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib14) )), employing multi-agent LLM frameworks for white-box compiler testing (e.g., WhiteFox ([yang2024whitefox,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib17) )), and enhancing the general reasoning and learning capabilities of LLM agents to improve coding performance (e.g., Reflexion ([shinn2023reflexion,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib13) )).\nThese diverse efforts underscore the potential of LLMs to reduce the manual effort required for test generation and enhance testing sophistication.\nHowever, the quality of LLM-generated tests is also critical; inadequately generated tests may fail to detect crucial bugs, leading to a false sense of security and the propagation of vulnerabilities into production systems.\nTo effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in generating unit tests, it is essential to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects real-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls.\n\nSeveral benchmarks have emerged to address this need ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ; [mundler2024swt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib20) ; [jain2024testgeneval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib6) ; [zhang2024testbench,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib21) ).\nFor example, TestEval ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ) introduced tasks based on 210 Python programs from LeetCode, focusing on achieving overall coverage, targeted line/branch coverage, and path coverage.\nTestBench ([zhang2024testbench,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib21) ) introduced a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on test generation tasks, focusing on the ability to generate tests that cover specific statements and branches in Java classes collected from real-world projects.\nSWT-Bench ([mundler2024swt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib20) ) transformed code repair tasks from SWE-Bench ([jimenez2023swe,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib22) ) into test generation tasks for issue reproduction, evaluating generated tests on whether they fail on the original code but pass on the patched version.\nSimilarly, TestGenEval ([jain2024testgeneval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib6) ) adapted SWE-Bench to create tasks for full test file generation and test completion, using execution-based metrics on code from large, well-maintained repositories.\nThese benchmarks have made significant contributions to the evaluation of LLMs on more realistic codebases, providing valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations.\n\nHowever, despite these contributions, we argue that the conclusions of prior studies rest on a precarious scientific foundation due to several critical limitations that challenge their scientific validity.\nFirstly, a foundational mismatch in evaluation granularity exists.\nIn software development, unit testing is typically performed at the function level, where individual functions are tested in isolation.\nHowever, benchmarks like TestBench ([zhang2024testbench,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib21) ), SWT-Bench ([mundler2024swt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib20) ), and TestGenEval ([jain2024testgeneval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib6) ) often operate at the class, integration, or even a file level, which does not accurately reflect common practice.\nSecondly, we identify the threat of insufficiently demanding evaluation (due to the “toy” code examples denoting relatively trivial test generation challenges).\nFor scientific conclusions to be valid, they must be tested on realistic code; while it is hard to determine what constitutes “realistic” code, many existing benchmarks are clearly unrealistic due to their low structural complexity.\nSpecifically, many of their functions exhibit low cyclomatic complexity, which can lead to inflated performance metrics as models are not adequately challenged to handle complex logic.\n\nFinally, a more insidious threat is data leak-through.\nA significant concern is data contamination, where the code and associated tests from public repositories may have already been part of the training corpora for many contemporary LLMs222<https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2025/icse-2025-SRC/6/Revisiting-SWE-Bench-On-the-Importance-of-Data-Quality-for-LLM-based-Code-Models> ([zhou2025lessleak,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib23) ; [ouedraogo2024large,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib24) ).\nThis leakage compromises the reliability of an evaluation, as a model might achieve high performance due to memorization rather than genuine capability.\nThese combined limitations mean that previous work may be scientifically unreliable, potentially presenting a distorted view of LLM capabilities.\n\nThis paper directly and systematically confronts these issues by introducing ULT (UnLeakedTestBench), a new benchmark that offers a more sound scientific basis on which to base future empirical evaluations of LLM-based unit test generation.\nThe construction of ULT was guided by three key principles: real-world relevance, cyclomatic complexity, and decontamination.\nSpecifically, we sourced our candidate functions from The Stack v2 ([lozhkov2024starcoder,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib25) ), a large and diverse corpus of permissively licensed source code.\nTo ensure the functions in ULT are sufficiently complex, we filtered out those with low cyclomatic complexity, retaining only those that present a meaningful challenge.\nMost importantly, to mitigate data contamination, we rigorously filtered out functions that have associated test cases already present in the training corpus.\nThis process yielded a total of 3,909 function-level tasks, each with a cyclomatic complexity of at least 10, ensuring that the functions challenge an LLM’s reasoning ability rather than its memorization.\n\nTo enable a controlled study of data contamination’s effects, we also introduce a counterpart benchmark: PLT (PreLeakedTestBench).\nThis benchmark is composed of the very functions that were excluded during the decontamination phase of creating ULT.\nThese functions also meet our high-complexity criteria but are intentionally “leaked”, as their ground-truth tests were found within the public data.\nBy providing this set alongside its clean counterpart, we facilitate a direct and controlled analysis of memorization versus reasoning.\nUsing ULT and PLT in tandem allows researchers to accurately measure performance inflation and achieve a more transparent and scientifically valid assessment of LLM capabilities in unit test generation.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of ULT, we conducted a large-scale empirical study involving 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their performance on ULT against established benchmarks such as TestEval ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ), as well as the counterpart benchmark PLT.\nOur experiments reveal that ULT poses a significantly greater challenge than other benchmarks, with LLMs achieving substantially lower accuracy and code coverage. For example, test cases generated by LLMs only achieve 41.32%, 45.10%, 30.22%, and 40.21% for accuracy, statement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all LLMs, respectively, which are substantially lower than the corresponding metrics on TestEval (91.79%, 92.18%, 82.04%, and 49.69%) and PLT (47.07%, 55.13%, 40.07%, and 50.80%).\nMoreover, we observe a strong correlation between test generation performance and the code generation performance of LLMs on ULT. For example, the correlation coefficient between the code generation performance and test generation performance (P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200b1Pass@1italic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ 1) on ULT is 0.79 (p = 0.002), while it is only 0.56 (p = 0.059) and 0.52 (p = 0.080) on TestEval and PLT, respectively.\nThis finding underscores the effectiveness of ULT in measuring the true test generation capabilities of LLMs, as it mitigates the influence of memorization and focuses on the model’s ability to reason about and generate tests for complex, real-world code.\n\nIn summary, this paper makes the following contributions:\n\nWe present ULT, a new, large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLM-based unit test generation, comprising 3,909 real-world Python functions. Its key innovation lies in a rigorous curation process that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case contamination.\nOur experiments demonstrate that ULT poses a significantly greater challenge than existing benchmarks, revealing the current limitations of LLMs when faced with complex and uncontaminated real-world code.\n\nWe also present PLT, a counterpart benchmark designed to isolate the effects of data contamination while ensuring tasks are both realistic and complex. It allows for a controlled analysis of memorization versus reasoning in test generation, enabling researchers to accurately measure performance inflation and achieve a more transparent and scientifically valid assessment of LLM capabilities.\n\nWe conduct a large-scale empirical study involving 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their performance on ULT against established benchmarks such as TestEval and PLT. Our results reveal that ULT presents a significantly greater challenge, with LLMs achieving substantially lower accuracy and code coverage compared to existing benchmarks.\n\nWe provide strong empirical evidence that our design principles lead to a more reliable evaluation. We show that performance on ULT has a strong, positive correlation with a model’s intrinsic coding ability, confirming that it measures generalization. Conversely, we demonstrate that performance on contaminated data is skewed by memorization, particularly for branch coverage.\n\n## 2. Background\n\nIn this section, we provide the necessary background to understand the context and significance of our work. We begin by discussing the importance of software testing, particularly unit testing, in ensuring software quality and reliability. We then explore the historical evolution of automated test case generation techniques, highlighting the challenges faced by traditional methods. Finally, we introduce the recent advancements in LLMs and their potential to revolutionize test case generation, while emphasizing the critical need for rigorous benchmarks to evaluate their effectiveness.\n\n### 2.1. Unit Testing in Software Engineering\n\nIn recent years, software systems have been widely adopted across various domains, including web applications, mobile apps, embedded systems, and enterprise software.\nThese systems exist in nearly every aspect of daily life and commerce, making their reliability and robustness paramount ([sommerville2011software,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib26) ).\nIf the software systems fail, they can lead to significant consequences, including financial losses, reputational damage, and even risks to human safety.\nTo ensure software quality, software testing is the primary mechanism employed within the discipline of software engineering ([myers2011art,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib27) ). It encompasses a systematic collection of activities designed to verify that a software system performs according to its specifications and to identify defects prior to operational deployment.\nSoftware testing is typically structured into several distinct levels, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing, each with a specific focus and scope, where unit testing occupies a foundational position in the development lifecycle ([runeson2006survey,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib28) ).\nThe primary goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit behaves as expected under various conditions, thereby ensuring that the individual components function correctly before they are integrated into larger systems ([meszaros2007xunit,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib29) ).\nEffective unit testing can significantly reduce the number of defects that propagate to later stages of development, where they become more costly and complex to resolve ([myers2011art,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib27) ).\n\n### 2.2. Automated Test Case Generation\n\nDespite unit testing can substantially improve software quality, it still poses significant challenges for software developers, i.e., the manual creation of comprehensive test suites is often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and requires a deep understanding of both the code under test and established software testing principles ([daka2014survey,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib7) ).\nThe key reason is that crafting effective test cases necessitates meticulous consideration of a wide array of input values, including typical cases, boundary conditions, and potential edge cases, to ensure adequate exploration of the unit’s functionality and execution paths. If the development team is under tight deadlines, they may not have sufficient time to create comprehensive test suites, leading to insufficient coverage and potentially undetected bugs. Then, the manual efforts required by the test generation become a bottleneck in many software development workflows, as developers must balance the need for thorough testing with the constraints of time and resources ([shamshiri2015automated,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib30) ). This challenge is further compounded by the increasing complexity of modern software systems, which often involve intricate logic, numerous dependencies, and diverse input formats.\n\nTo address these challenges, the field of software engineering has long pursued the development of automated test case generation (ATG) techniques.\nATG aims to automate the test case generation process, thereby alleviating the manual burden on developers and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of software testing ([daka2014survey,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib7) ).\nTraditional ATG methods encompass a variety of methodologies, including symbolic execution ([king1976symbolic,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib31) ; [chipounov2012s2e,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib32) ), search-based software testing (SBST) ([mcminn2011search,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib33) ), and fuzz testing ([miller1990empirical,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib34) ).\nSymbolic execution ([king1976symbolic,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib31) ; [chipounov2012s2e,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib32) ) systematically explores program paths by treating input values as symbolic variables and deriving path constraints that can be solved to generate concrete test inputs.\nSearch-based software testing (SBST) ([mcminn2011search,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib33) ) reformulates test generation as an optimization problem, employing metaheuristic search algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, simulated annealing) to discover test inputs that satisfy specific testing objectives, such as maximizing branch coverage.\nFuzz testing ([miller1990empirical,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib34) ) involves generating a large volume of random or semi-random inputs to uncover crashes, assertion violations, or unexpected program behaviors.\nWhile these traditional ATG methods have achieved notable successes and have been incorporated into various practical development tools, they are often confronted with inherent limitations, i.e., the scalability to large and complex software systems, the difficulty in handling intricate program state or complex input constraints, and the tendency to generate tests that lack semantic relevance to real-world usage scenarios ([anand2013orchestrated,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib1) ).\nFor example, symbolic execution can suffer from path explosion in programs with numerous branches and loops, rendering exhaustive exploration infeasible.\nSimilarly, unguided random fuzzing might be inefficient in achieving deep coverage of intricate program logic without specific domain knowledge or more sophisticated input generation strategies.\n\n### 2.3. LLM-Driven Automated Test Generation\n\nTo address the limitations of traditional ATG methods, recent research has increasingly turned to utilizing LLMs for automated test generation ([hou2024large,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib35) ; [chen2022codet,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib9) ; [deng2023large,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib18) ; [huang2023agentcoder,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib11) ; [deng2023fuzzgpt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib19) ; [yang2025kernelgpt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib14) ; [yang2024whitefox,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib17) ).\nDifferent with traditional ATG techniques, LLMs leverage their extensive training on diverse codebases and natural language to generate test cases that are not only syntactically correct but also semantically meaningful and contextually relevant.\nCompared to traditional ATG methods, existing works in LLM-driven test generation have demonstrated significant promise and versatility across diverse testing scenarios.\nFor example, TitanFuzz ([deng2023large,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib18) ) employs LLMs to generate syntactically and semantically valid inputs for fuzzing Deep Learning (DL) libraries, implicitly learning complex API constraints, while FuzzGPT ([deng2023fuzzgpt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib19) ) refines LLMs to synthesize unusual programs for fuzzing by leveraging historical bug data. Beyond input generation, LLMs are being explored for more complex testing workflows, including the synthesis of syscall specifications for kernel fuzzing (e.g., KernelGPT ([yang2025kernelgpt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib14) )) and the development of multi-agent LLM frameworks for white-box compiler testing (e.g., WhiteFox ([yang2024whitefox,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib17) )).\nAnother notable application includes the generation of test cases for specific functions or classes, where LLMs can produce syntactically valid inputs that cover various execution paths and edge cases. For instance, CodeT ([chen2022codet,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib9) ) and AgentCoder ([huang2023agentcoder,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib11) ) utilize LLMs to generate test cases for specific functions, while Mercury ([du2024mercury,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib12) ) employs LLMs to generate test cases for complex Python functions with intricate logic.\nThese approaches have demonstrated the potential of LLMs to significantly reduce manual effort, improve the quality and relevance of generated tests, and handle complex code structures with greater intuitive facility than some traditional methods.\nHowever, despite the promising results, the effectiveness of LLMs in test generation is not uniform and can vary significantly based on several factors, including the model architecture, training data, and specific task formulation.\n\n### 2.4. The Need for Rigorous Benchmarking\n\nTo effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in generating unit tests, it is essential to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects real-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. An well-constructed benchmark for LLM-based test generation should ideally provide a multi-dimensional assessment.\nThis includes evaluating their ability to generate correct test cases, the extent to which these tests cover the code under test (e.g., statement and branch coverage), and their effectiveness in detecting faults through metrics such as mutation testing scores ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ).\nRecently, several benchmarks have emerged to address this need ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ; [mundler2024swt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib20) ; [jain2024testgeneval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib6) ; [zhang2024testbench,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib21) ). For example, TestEval ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ) introduced tasks based on 210 Python programs from LeetCode, focusing on achieving overall coverage, targeted line/branch coverage, and path coverage.\nTestBench ([zhang2024testbench,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib21) ) introduced a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on test generation tasks, focusing on the ability to generate tests that cover specific statements and branches in Java classes collected from real-world projects.\nSWT-Bench ([mundler2024swt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib20) ) transformed code repair tasks from SWE-Bench ([jimenez2023swe,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib22) ) into test generation tasks for issue reproduction, evaluating generated tests on whether they fail on the original code but pass on the patched version.\nSimilarly, TestGenEval ([jain2024testgeneval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib6) ) adapted SWE-Bench to create tasks for full test file generation and test completion, using execution-based metrics on code from large, well-maintained repositories.\nThese benchmarks have made significant contributions to the evaluation of LLMs on more realistic codebases, providing valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations.\n\nHowever, despite their contributions, existing benchmarks face several critical limitations, which can undermine the reliability and generalizability of their findings.\nFirstly, in software development, unit testing is typically performed at the function level, where individual functions are tested in isolation. However, benchmarks like TestBench, SWT-Bench, and TestGenEval often operate at the class, integration, or even a file level, which may not accurately reflect the common practice of unit testing at the function level.\nSecondly, many of the functions in these benchmarks exhibit low cyclomatic complexity, meaning they are structurally simple and do not adequately challenge an LLM’s ability to generate tests for more complex logic and diverse execution paths. This can lead to inflated performance metrics, as LLMs can achieve high coverage with relatively few, straightforward test cases.\nFinally, a significant concern is data contamination, where the code and potentially associated tests from public repositories may have already been part of the training corpora for many contemporary LLMs ([zhou2025lessleak,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib23) ). This leakage compromises the reliability of the evaluation, as LLMs might demonstrate high performance due to memorization rather than genuine test generation capabilities.\nThese limitations can lead to an unreliable assessment of an LLM’s inherent test generation ability, as the benchmarks may not accurately reflect the challenges and complexities encountered in real-world software development.\n\nTo address these limitations and provide a more reliable benchmark, we introduce ULT, a novel dataset constructed for evaluating LLM-driven test case generation for real-world, function-level Python tasks. ULT is designed to mitigate the identified shortcomings of existing benchmarks by focusing on function-level testing, incorporating a diverse set of tasks with varying complexity, and ensuring that the dataset is free from data contamination. By providing a more accurate and challenging evaluation framework, ULT aims to enhance the understanding of LLM capabilities in generating high-quality unit tests for Python code.\n\n## 3. Methodology\n\n### 3.1. Overview\n\nIn this section, we present the benchmark construction process for ULT and PLT, two benchmarks designed to evaluate LLM-driven unit test generation for real-world Python functions.\nSpecifically, we first detail the multi-stage curation process designed to yield a high-quality dataset characterized by real-world relevance, controlled complexity, and mitigated data contamination.\nSubsequently, we define the distinct task formats through which LLMs are prompted and their test generation capabilities are assessed.\nFinally, we outline the specific effectiveness metrics used to quantify and compare the performance of LLMs in these tasks.\n\n### 3.2. Benchmark Construction\n\nData Collection We aim to evaluate LLMs’ ability to generate unit tests for real-world Python functions, focusing on their capacity to cover diverse program statements and execution branches. To achieve this, we begin by collecting candidate Python functions from The Stack v2 ([lozhkov2024starcoder,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib25) ), a large and diverse corpus of permissively licensed source code. The Stack v2 is a vast collection of open-source code, encompassing a wide range of programming languages and domains, making it an ideal source for our benchmark.\n\nAfter collecting the candidate functions, we implement a rigorous multi-stage filtering pipeline to select suitable candidates. The filtering process is designed to ensure that the selected functions are sufficiently complex, self-contained, and free from contamination (for ULT only), by pre-existing test cases. We introduce each step in the following.\n\nFiltering by Cyclomatic Complexity One of the core aims of our benchmark work is to assess an LLM’s ability to generate test cases for functions with non-trivial control flow, thereby requiring tests that cover code statements and branches. Functions that are overly simplistic (e.g., possessing only a single execution path) do not offer a discerning challenge for this purpose. To address this, we follow the setup of TestEval ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ) and employ cyclomatic complexity333<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity> as a quantitative measure of a program’s structural complexity. Given the control flow graph of a program, its cyclomatic complexity VVitalic\\_V is defined as V=e−n+pV=e-n+pitalic\\_V = italic\\_e - italic\\_n + italic\\_p, where eeitalic\\_e is the number of edges, nnitalic\\_n is the number of nodes, and ppitalic\\_p is the number of connected components in the graph. A higher cyclomatic complexity generally indicates a greater number of decision points and potential execution paths within a function. We filter out functions with a cyclomatic complexity of less than 10. The functions retained in our dataset after all filtering stages possess an average cyclomatic complexity of 14.87, ensuring a substantive level of logical complexity for testing.\n\nWe acknowledge that the use of cyclomatic complexity can be controversial, with some studies arguing that it often serves as a proxy for code size (shepperd:critique-mccabe; henderson-sellers:clarification).\nHowever, we do not claim it necessarily refers to any “conceptual complexity” of the code. Instead, we use it strictly as a structural filter for our evaluation examples. While filtering by code size alone is an option, it would not guarantee the selection of functions with the nested Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures that characterize complex control flow. Without this filter, we might inadvertently include long methods that lack any significant branching substructure. By enforcing a minimum cyclomatic complexity, we explicitly select for functions that possess non-trivial branching logic. Therefore, we use it as a measure of AST complexity, and since it is also correlated with size, we ensure that as complexity increases, we are evaluating larger programs with meaningful branching. We further validate this assumption by analyzing the correlation between cyclomatic complexity and the performance of LLMs on our test generation tasks (See [Section\xa06.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.SS1 "6.1. RQ2: To what extent does the cyclomatic complexity of functions in ULT influence LLM performance compared to other benchmarks? ‣ 6. rq1.3 ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions")).\n\nSelf-Containment For effective unit test generation, it is crucial that the function under test (FUT) can be evaluated in relative isolation, without complex external dependencies that the LLM might lack context for, such as custom functions or classes defined elsewhere in a large project. If a function heavily relies on other custom functions or classes defined elsewhere in a large project, an LLM provided only with the FUT’s source code may struggle to generate correct and executable tests due to missing knowledge of these external components. Therefore, we analyzed the remaining functions to identify and filter out those that exhibited direct dependencies on or interactions with other non-standard, user-defined functions or complex class structures not passed as simple arguments. This step aims to ensure that the context provided to the LLM (primarily the function’s own source code and potentially its signature) is largely sufficient for generating meaningful tests.\n\nTestability Guarantee While a function might be self-contained in terms of custom project-specific code, it often relies on standard Python libraries or widely-used third-party packages (e.g., numpy, pandas, glob, csv, logging). For each of the functions that passed the cyclomatic complexity and self-containment filters, we first verified that it was indeed testable by developing at least three distinct, executable test inputs. If a function could not be tested by the input tests, we then feed it to GPT-4o to check whether bugs exist in the function. If bugs are found, we will requires GPT-4o to fix the bugs and re-verify the testability of the function. We set the debugging limit to 3 times, i.e., if the function is still not testable after 3 times of debugging, we will discard the function. This step served as a crucial quality check, ensuring that the functions selected for the benchmark are avaliable to unit testing. During this process, we also identified and explicitly added necessary import statements for standard Python libraries and common, permissively licensed third-party libraries directly into the context provided for each function. This ensures that the code, when presented to an LLM and subsequently when its generated tests are executed, has its immediate dependencies readily available.\n\nDecontamination\nThe final step in our benchmark construction is the decontamination process, which allows us to define two benchmarks for a controlled analysis: ULT and PLT.\nOur primary concern is mitigating the leakage of pre-existing test cases, as a model’s performance could reflect memorization rather than genuine test generation aptitude if LLMs were trained on them.\nTo identify contamination, we first extracted the name of each candidate function (e.g., func\\_name) and searched The Stack v2 for corresponding test definitions (e.g., def test\\_func\\_name) or assertions (e.g., assert func\\_name).\nFunctions for which no corresponding test cases were found form our primary benchmark, ULT, providing a rigorous evaluation of an LLM’s generalization ability.\nOur second benchmark, PLT, is a superset that contains all the functions from ULT plus all the functions that were identified as potentially contaminated.\nBy including the decontaminated set within the leaked set, PLT represents a benchmark with mixed data quality, allowing researchers to measure the specific impact of data contamination by comparing performance against the purely decontaminated ULT.\n\nAfter applying these steps, we retained a total of 3,909 function-level tasks for ULT, and 18,169 function-level tasks for PLT.\n\n### 3.3. Task Definition\n\nTo measure the test generation capabilities of LLMs, we follow the setup of TestEval ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ) and define a KKitalic\\_K-query function-level unit test generation task. This task is designed to evaluate the model’s ability to generate high-quality (i.e., correct, diverse, and effective) test cases for a given function under test (FUT).\nDuring the evaluation, the LLM is first provided with the source code of a single function and is prompted to generate a set of test cases that cover various aspects of the function’s behavior.\nThen, for other queries (2≤i≤K2\\leq i\\leq K2 ≤ italic\\_i ≤ italic\\_K), the LLM is provided with the source code of the FUT and all previously generated test cases, and is prompted to generate a new test case that is distinct from all previously generated ones.\nThe detailed task definition is as follows:\n\nInitial Round (Round 1):\nIn the first round (i=1i=1italic\\_i = 1), the LLM is provided with the source code of the FUT.\nIt is then prompted to generate a single unit test case for this function.\n\nSubsequent Rounds (Round i>1i>1italic\\_i > 1):\nFor each subsequent round iiitalic\\_i (from 222 to KKitalic\\_K), the prompt is dynamically updated and expanded.\nThe new prompt contains both the original FUT and the set of all test cases that were successfully generated in the previous rounds (1,…,i−11,\\dots,i-11 , … , italic\\_i - 1).\nThe LLM is then explicitly instructed to generate one new test case that is distinct and different from all the previously generated ones provided in the prompt’s context.\n\nThis iterative process is repeated until KKitalic\\_K test cases have been generated. The final output is a test suite built through a sequence of diversification requests.\n\n### 3.4. Effectiveness Metrics\n\nWe employ a suite of well-established software testing metrics to measure the quality of the LLM-generated test cases, which are designed to assess various aspects of the generated tests, including their correctness, coverage, and fault-detection capabilities.\n\n#### 3.4.1. Test Generation Accuracy (P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200bkPass@kitalic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ italic\\_k)\n\nTest generation accuracy measures the proportion of correct test cases generated by the LLM. A test is treated as “correct” if it compiles, runs to completion, and its assertions reflect valid expectations of the function’s behavior for the given inputs.\nIn our benchmark, we define the accuracy metric as P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200bkPass@kitalic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ italic\\_k, which represents the average number of correct tests generated per function, normalized by the total number of test cases requested (KKitalic\\_K).\nThe calculation of P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200bkPass@kitalic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ italic\\_k is based on the number of correct tests generated for each function, where CiC\\_{i}italic\\_C start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the number of correct tests generated for the iiitalic\\_i-th function (where 0≤Ci≤K0\\leq C\\_{i}\\leq K0 ≤ italic\\_C start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≤ italic\\_K).\nIf NNitalic\\_N is the total number of functions in the benchmark, the accuracy is computed as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (1) |  | P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200bk=∑i=1NCiN×KPass@k=\\frac{\\sum\\_{i=1}^{N}C\\_{i}}{N\\times K}italic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ italic\\_k = divide start\\_ARG ∑ start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i = 1 end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_N end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_C start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT end\\_ARG start\\_ARG italic\\_N × italic\\_K end\\_ARG |  |\n\n#### 3.4.2. Code Coverage (L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkLCov@kitalic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k / B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkBCov@kitalic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k)\n\nIn addition to accuracy, we also measure the code coverage achieved by the generated test cases.\nCode coverage is an important metric in software testing, as it indicates the extent to which the generated tests exercise the code under test. We report the code coverage across all functions for two standard metrics: Line Coverage (L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkLCov@kitalic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k) and Branch Coverage (B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkBCov@kitalic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k).\nL\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkLCov@kitalic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k is the percentage of executable lines in the function’s source code that are executed by at first kkitalic\\_k queries generated test cases.\nB\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkBCov@kitalic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k is the percentage of possible execution branches (e.g., from “if” or “while” statements) that are traversed by the test suite generated by the first kkitalic\\_k queries.\nWe also provide the improvement of coverage over the first query, i.e., ΔL\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bk\\Delta\\_{LCov@k}roman\\_Δ start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ΔB\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bk\\Delta\\_{BCov@k}roman\\_Δ start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT, to measure the incremental coverage achieved by each additional test case generated.\n\n#### 3.4.3. Mutation Score (M\u200bu\u200bt\u200b@\u200bkMut@kitalic\\_M italic\\_u italic\\_t @ italic\\_k)\n\nFinally, we follow the existing work ([jain2024testgeneval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib6) ) and measure the fault-detection capability of the generated test cases using mutation score.\nMutation score is a widely used metric in software testing that evaluates the effectiveness of a test suite in detecting faults ([papadakis2019mutation,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib36) ; [jia2010analysis,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib37) ).\nThis metric involves automatically introducing small, syntactic changes (e.g., changing “+” to “-”, or “¿” to “¿=”) into the function under test to create faulty versions known as “mutants”.\nIn our evaluation, we use Cosmic-Ray444<https://cosmic-ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> to generate all possible mutants for each function in ULT.\nA test suite “kills” a mutant if it fails when run against the mutated code but passes on the original.\nThe mutation score is the percentage of non-equivalent mutants that are killed by the generated test suite. In our evaluation, for each function, we set timeout = 120 to avoid the test suite running indefinitely on a mutant.\nThe mutation score is calculated as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (2) |  | M\u200bu\u200bt\u200b@\u200bk=∑i=1NMiNMut@k=\\frac{\\sum\\_{i=1}^{N}M\\_{i}}{N}italic\\_M italic\\_u italic\\_t @ italic\\_k = divide start\\_ARG ∑ start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i = 1 end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_N end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_M start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT end\\_ARG start\\_ARG italic\\_N end\\_ARG |  |\n\nwhere MiM\\_{i}italic\\_M start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the number of mutants killed by the test suite generated for the iiitalic\\_i-th function, and NNitalic\\_N is the total number of functions in the benchmark.\nA higher score indicates a more effective test suite at finding bugs.\n\n## 4. Experiment Design\n\n### 4.1. Research Questions\n\nWe formulate three research questions that guide our empirical evaluation. These questions are designed to compare the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on ULT against established benchmarks as well as PLT.\n\nRQ1: To what extent do LLMs struggle with test generation on ULT compared to other benchmarks?\n\nRQ2: To what extent does the cyclomatic complexity of functions in ULT influence LLM performance compared to other benchmarks?\n\nRQ3: How does data contamination affect the assessment of test case generation?\n\n### 4.2. Models and Baselines\n\nTo answer our research questions, we conduct a comprehensive study involving a diverse set of LLMs and a comparative analysis against established benchmarks.\n\n#### 4.2.1. Evaluation LLMs\n\nWe selected a wide range of 12 state-of-the-art LLMs to ensure a broad and representative evaluation.\nThe selection includes models of varying sizes, from smaller models with under 2 billion parameters to large models with over 30 billion parameters.\nIt also covers both general-purpose instruction-tuned models and models specifically specialized for code generation and understanding.\nThe complete list of evaluated models is detailed in [Tab.\xa01](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S4.T1 "In 4.2.1. Evaluation LLMs ‣ 4.2. Models and Baselines ‣ 4. Experiment Design ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions").\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Category | Models |\n| CodeLlama | CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf |\n| Seed-Coder | Seed-Coder-8B-Instruct |\n| DeepSeekCoder | deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct, 6.7b-instruct, 33b-instruct |\n| Gemma-3 | gemma-3-4b-it, 12b-it, 27b-it |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder | Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, 14B-Instruct, 32B-Instruct |\n| Microsoft Phi-4 | Phi-4-mini-instruct |\n\n#### 4.2.2. Baseline Benchmarks\n\nSeveral benchmarks have been proposed to measure the capability of LLMs in generating test cases, such as TestEval ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ), TestGenEval ([jain2024testgeneval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib6) ), TestBench ([zhang2024testbench,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib21) ), and SWT-Bench ([mundler2024swt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib20) ).\nHowever, these benchmarks either focus on programming languages other than Python (e.g., TestBench focuses on Java tasks) or do not specifically target function-level unit test case generation (e.g., TestGenEval and SWT-Bench).\nIn this work, we then focus on the performance of the selected LLMs on ULT against TestEval ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ). TestEval is a well-established benchmark for evaluating LLMs on test generation tasks, focusing on Python functions from competitive programming-style problems. Similar to ULT, the tasks in TestEval are also designed to the function-level unit test generation, making it a suitable baseline for our study. In addition, we also include PLT, which is a superset of ULT that includes all the functions from ULT plus all the functions that were identified as potentially contaminated. This allows us to measure the specific impact of data contamination by comparing performance against the purely decontaminated ULT.\n\n### 4.3. Inference Configuration\n\nTo ensure the fairness of our evaluation and the reproducibility of our results, we employ a consistent inference configuration across all evaluated LLMs. For generating test cases, we use a greedy decoding strategy to minimize randomness and ensure that the output is primarily a function of the model’s inherent capabilities rather than stochastic sampling. Specifically, we set the decoding temperature to 0.00.00.0. This low value encourages the model to select high-probability tokens, yielding outputs that are stable and deterministic while still allowing for some minor variation from a purely greedy approach. The maximum number of new tokens to be generated for any given task is set to 102410241024, which is sufficient to generate test cases without truncation.\n\n| Model\\_Name | P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200b1Pass@1italic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ 1 | | | P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200b2Pass@2italic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ 2 | | | P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200b5Pass@5italic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ 5 | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ULT | PLT | TestEval | ULT | PLT | TestEval | ULT | PLT | TestEval |\n| CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf | 9.98 | 40.99 | 68.10 | 9.68 (-0.29) | 37.28 (-3.71) | 66.67 (-1.43) | 8.78 (-1.19) | 32.72 (-8.27) | 66.10 (-2.00) |\n| Seed-Coder-8B-Instruct | 13.28 | 52.70 | 76.67 | 14.26 (+0.98) | 51.06 (-1.64) | 74.29 (-2.38) | 14.32 (+1.04) | 48.94 (-3.75) | 68.29 (-8.38) |\n| gemma-3-4b-it | 11.03 | 40.52 | 30.00 | 11.33 (+0.31) | 40.18 (-0.34) | 29.05 (-0.95) | 11.78 (+0.75) | 39.35 (-1.18) | 30.48 (+0.48) |\n| gemma-3-12b-it | 12.38 | 51.40 | 52.86 | 12.48 (+0.10) | 49.96 (-1.44) | 55.24 (+2.38) | 13.69 (+1.31) | 48.84 (-2.56) | 54.29 (+1.43) |\n| gemma-3-27b-it | 17.83 | 53.12 | 59.05 | 20.26 (+2.43) | 53.89 (+0.78) | 60.95 (+1.90) | 21.64 (+3.81) | 54.00 (+0.89) | 60.76 (+1.71) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct | 12.48 | 52.54 | 52.38 | 13.47 (+0.98) | 51.23 (-1.32) | 57.14 (+4.76) | 14.05 (+1.57) | 49.30 (-3.25) | 53.33 (+0.95) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct | 15.32 | 57.92 | 70.00 | 15.73 (+0.41) | 56.41 (-1.51) | 61.90 (-8.10) | 15.80 (+0.48) | 54.86 (-3.07) | 55.81 (-14.19) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | 17.83 | 57.38 | 77.62 | 15.90 (-1.93) | 55.42 (-1.96) | 66.19 (-11.43) | 16.04 (-1.79) | 53.95 (-3.44) | 59.05 (-18.57) |\n| deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct | 9.39 | 37.75 | 38.57 | 7.57 (-1.82) | 34.52 (-3.23) | 39.05 (+0.48) | 6.56 (-2.83) | 32.73 (-5.03) | 39.90 (+1.33) |\n| deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct | 10.62 | 44.84 | 55.71 | 9.38 (-1.24) | 41.23 (-3.61) | 52.62 (-3.10) | 8.60 (-2.02) | 37.48 (-7.36) | 49.81 (-5.90) |\n| deepseek-coder-33b-instruct | 13.64 | 49.17 | 72.86 | 11.91 (-1.73) | 46.13 (-3.04) | 61.19 (-11.67) | 11.02 (-2.61) | 42.93 (-6.23) | 56.10 (-16.76) |\n| Phi-4-mini-instruct | 8.52 | 42.76 | 39.05 | 9.21 (+0.69) | 41.18 (-1.58) | 38.57 (-0.48) | 8.55 (+0.03) | 38.33 (-4.43) | 29.24 (-9.81) |\n| Overall | 12.69 | 48.42 | 57.74 | 12.60 (-0.09) | 46.54 (-1.88) | 55.24 (-2.50) | 12.57 (-0.12) | 44.45 (-3.97) | 51.93 (-5.81) |\n\n## 5. Results and Findings\n\n### 5.1. RQ1: To what extent do LLMs struggle with test generation on ULT compared to other benchmarks?\n\nTo answer RQ1, we compare the performance of various LLMs on ULT against their performance on TestEval and PLT 555We also provide the cyclomatic complexity distribution level analysis in [Section\xa06.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.SS1 "6.1.

Experiment Design ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), which demonstrate that the accuracy of LLM-generated test cases on ULT is significantly lower than on TestEval and PLT.\nFor example, the average P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200b1Pass@1italic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ 1 across all models is 12.69% on ULT, compared to 48.42% on PLT and 57.74% on TestEval.\nThe P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200b2Pass@2italic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ 2 and P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200b5Pass@5italic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ 5 metrics show similar trends, with average scores of 12.60% and 12.57% on ULT, respectively, compared to 46.54% and 44.45% on PLT, and 55.24% and 51.93% on TestEval.\nNext, we can also observe that the performance gap consistently exists across all model families and all metrics.\nFor example, for CodeLlama-7B-Instruct-hf, the P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200b1Pass@1italic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ 1 score is 9.98% on ULT, while it is 40.99% on PLT and 68.10% on TestEval, indicating a performance drop of 31.01% and 58.12% when compared to PLT and TestEval, respectively.\nThe results indicate that LLMs struggle significantly with test generation on ULT compared to PLT and TestEval, suggesting that ULT presents a more challenging and realistic evaluation of LLMs’ test generation capabilities compared to other benchmarks.\n\n| Model\\_Name | L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b1LCov@1italic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 1 | | | L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b2LCov@2italic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 2 | | | L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5LCov@5italic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5 | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ULT | PLT | TestEval | ULT | PLT | TestEval | ULT | PLT | TestEval |\n| CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf | 34.31 | 37.40 | 83.34 | 37.37 (+3.05) | 43.00 (+5.61) | 85.32 (+1.98) | 39.67 (+5.36) | 47.10 (+9.71) | 86.85 (+3.52) |\n| Seed-Coder-8B-Instruct | 41.38 | 43.95 | 92.51 | 46.11 (+4.73) | 51.54 (+7.59) | 94.71 (+2.20) | 51.57 (+10.19) | 61.35 (+17.40) | 96.60 (+4.09) |\n| gemma-3-4b-it | 35.02 | 38.66 | 71.09 | 38.90 (+3.87) | 45.55 (+6.89) | 73.35 (+2.26) | 43.92 (+8.90) | 54.74 (+16.08) | 74.78 (+3.70) |\n| gemma-3-12b-it | 40.30 | 43.22 | 90.46 | 45.64 (+5.34) | 52.02 (+8.80) | 94.53 (+4.07) | 52.05 (+11.76) | 63.03 (+19.81) | 97.31 (+6.85) |\n| gemma-3-27b-it | 41.09 | 44.75 | 91.13 | 46.76 (+5.67) | 53.16 (+8.40) | 94.92 (+3.80) | 53.74 (+12.65) | 64.03 (+19.28) | 97.14 (+6.01) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct | 40.73 | 43.37 | 91.47 | 45.74 (+5.01) | 51.39 (+8.03) | 94.85 (+3.38) | 51.99 (+11.27) | 62.42 (+19.05) | 97.25 (+5.78) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct | 40.64 | 43.39 | 92.35 | 45.44 (+4.80) | 51.10 (+7.71) | 94.99 (+2.63) | 52.11 (+11.47) | 62.89 (+19.50) | 97.17 (+4.82) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | 41.32 | 44.38 | 91.79 | 47.04 (+5.72) | 53.23 (+8.85) | 95.12 (+3.32) | 52.87 (+11.55) | 63.89 (+19.51) | 97.24 (+5.45) |\n| deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct | 28.28 | 32.35 | 86.19 | 30.67 (+2.39) | 37.37 (+5.02) | 88.18 (+1.99) | 30.98 (+2.70) | 38.12 (+5.77) | 88.24 (+2.05) |\n| deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct | 25.88 | 31.72 | 90.46 | 29.05 (+3.17) | 38.48 (+6.75) | 93.12 (+2.66) | 32.83 (+6.96) | 46.86 (+15.14) | 95.10 (+4.64) |\n| deepseek-coder-33b-instruct | 29.95 | 34.34 | 92.31 | 33.47 (+3.52) | 40.93 (+6.59) | 94.46 (+2.15) | 37.11 (+7.17) | 47.86 (+13.52) | 95.75 (+3.44) |\n| Phi-4-mini-instruct | 35.69 | 37.86 | 80.63 | 39.02 (+3.33) | 43.54 (+5.68) | 81.62 (+1.00) | 42.35 (+6.66) | 49.32 (+11.46) | 82.69 (+2.06) |\n| Overall | 36.22 | 39.62 | 87.81 | 40.43 (+4.22) | 46.78 (+7.16) | 90.43 (+2.62) | 45.10 (+8.89) | 55.13 (+15.52) | 92.18 (+4.37) |\n\n#### 5.1.2. RQ1.2: Line coverage of LLM-generated test cases\n\nIn addition to accuracy, we also evaluate the line coverage of the test cases generated by the LLMs in ULT, PLT, and TestEval. The code line coverage results of LLM-generated test cases are shown in [Tab.\xa03](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S5.T3 "In 5.1.1. RQ1.1: Accuracy of LLM-generated test cases ‣ 5.1. RQ1: To what extent do LLMs struggle with test generation on ULT compared to other benchmarks? ‣ 5. Results and Findings ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions").\nWe can observe that the average line coverage (L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkLCov@kitalic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k) of LLM-generated test cases on ULT is lower than on TestEval and PLT across all models and all kkitalic\\_k values.\nFor example, the average L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b1LCov@1italic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 1 across all models is 36.22% on ULT, while it is 39.62% on PLT and 87.81% on TestEval, when the KKitalic\\_K is set to 1. This indicates that the functions in ULT are inherently more difficult to cover, as the LLMs struggle to generate test cases that cover a significant portion of the code lines.\nIn addition, we can also observe that when we increases the KKitalic\\_K, the L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkLCov@kitalic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k of LLM-generated test cases on ULT increases, but it remains lower than on TestEval and PLT. For instance, the average L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b2LCov@2italic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 2 on ULT is 40.43%, while it is 46.78% on PLT and 90.43% on TestEval. Similarly, the average L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5LCov@5italic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5 on ULT is 45.10%, while it is 55.13% on PLT and 92.18% on TestEval.\nThis indicates that even with multiple attempts, LLMs struggle to explore the source code of the complex, real-world functions in ULT as effectively as they do for the algorithmic problems in TestEval.\n\nFurthermore, we can observe that the improvement in line coverage of LLM-generated test cases on ULT is lower than PLT. For example, the average improvement of line coverage on ULT is 4.22% and 8.89%, while it is 7.16% and 15.52% on PLT for L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b2LCov@2italic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 2 and L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5LCov@5italic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5, respectively. We indicate that the key reason for this is that the LLMs based on its memorization ability can generate test cases that cover more lines in PLT, but they struggle to generate test cases that cover the lines in ULT 666We indicate the key reason for the lower improvement on TestEval are due to most of the lines in the function have been covered. Then, LLMs can only achieve lower improvement in line coverage for more test cases.\n\n| Model\\_Name | B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b1BCov@1italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 1 | | | B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b2BCov@2italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 2 | | | B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5BCov@5italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5 | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ULT | PLT | TestEval | ULT | PLT | TestEval | ULT | PLT | TestEval |\n| CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf | 15.55 | 18.08 | 61.93 | 19.20 (+3.65) | 24.54 (+6.46) | 66.29 (+4.36) | 22.33 (+6.77) | 29.53 (+11.46) | 70.73 (+8.80) |\n| Seed-Coder-8B-Instruct | 21.19 | 23.48 | 76.52 | 28.01 (+6.82) | 32.94 (+9.46) | 83.03 (+6.51) | 35.97 (+14.77) | 45.97 (+22.49) | 89.21 (+12.69) |\n| gemma-3-4b-it | 15.83 | 19.04 | 48.28 | 21.21 (+5.38) | 27.37 (+8.32) | 54.07 (+5.78) | 28.52 (+12.69) | 39.64 (+20.60) | 58.77 (+10.49) |\n| gemma-3-12b-it | 20.13 | 22.55 | 72.68 | 27.51 (+7.38) | 33.26 (+10.71) | 82.30 (+9.62) | 36.96 (+16.83) | 48.20 (+25.65) | 90.88 (+18.20) |\n| gemma-3-27b-it | 20.82 | 23.83 | 74.97 | 28.85 (+8.03) | 34.38 (+10.54) | 83.93 (+8.96) | 39.29 (+18.47) | 49.64 (+25.81) | 90.89 (+15.92) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct | 19.60 | 22.03 | 74.18 | 26.57 (+6.97) | 31.87 (+9.84) | 82.92 (+8.74) | 35.75 (+16.15) | 46.62 (+24.59) | 90.01 (+15.83) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct | 20.31 | 22.70 | 76.82 | 27.47 (+7.16) | 32.56 (+9.87) | 83.80 (+6.98) | 37.01 (+16.70) | 48.17 (+25.47) | 90.92 (+14.10) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | 20.40 | 23.12 | 75.47 | 28.53 (+8.13) | 34.17 (+11.05) | 84.32 (+8.85) | 37.57 (+17.17) | 49.01 (+25.89) | 91.26 (+15.79) |\n| deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct | 12.34 | 15.58 | 66.18 | 15.19 (+2.85) | 20.93 (+5.34) | 71.58 (+5.40) | 15.62 (+3.28) | 21.79 (+6.21) | 71.81 (+5.63) |\n| deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct | 12.25 | 16.07 | 73.62 | 16.63 (+4.39) | 24.08 (+8.01) | 80.62 (+7.00) | 22.16 (+9.91) | 34.97 (+18.89) | 86.79 (+13.18) |\n| deepseek-coder-33b-instruct | 14.77 | 17.57 | 75.76 | 19.74 (+4.96) | 25.21 (+7.64) | 81.88 (+6.12) | 25.13 (+10.36) | 34.55 (+16.97) | 86.37 (+10.61) |\n| Phi-4-mini-instruct | 16.56 | 18.28 | 60.82 | 21.37 (+4.81) | 25.30 (+7.01) | 63.66 (+2.84) | 26.30 (+9.74) | 32.80 (+14.51) | 66.82 (+6.00) |\n| Overall | 17.48 | 20.20 | 69.77 | 23.36 (+5.88) | 28.88 (+8.69) | 76.53 (+6.76) | 30.22 (+12.74) | 40.07 (+19.88) | 82.04 (+12.27) |\n\n#### 5.1.3. RQ1.3: Branch Coverage of LLM-generated test cases\n\n## 6. rq1.3\n\nNext, we analyze the branch coverage of the test cases generated by the LLMs on both ULT and other datasets.\nCompared to line coverage, branch coverage is a more complex metric that evaluates how well the test cases exercise different execution paths in the code, especially for functions with high cyclomatic complexity.\nThe evaluation results are shown in [Tab.\xa04](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S5.T4 "In 5.1.2. RQ1.2: Line coverage of LLM-generated test cases ‣ 5.1. RQ1: To what extent do LLMs struggle with test generation on ULT compared to other benchmarks? ‣ 5. Results and Findings ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), which reveal that the branch coverage of LLM-generated test cases on ULT is significantly lower than on other datasets.\nFor example, the average branch coverage for a single generated test (B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b1BCov@1italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 1) across all models is 17.48% on ULT, compared to 20.20% and 69.77% on PLT and TestEval, which indicates that the functions in ULT are inherently more difficult to cover, as they often involve intricate control flows and multiple branches.\nEven with multiple test cases, the branch coverage on ULT remains lower than on PLT and TestEval. For instance, the average B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5BCov@5italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5 on ULT is 30.22%, while it reaches 40.07% and 82.04% on PLT and TestEval. This suggests that even with multiple attempts, LLMs struggle to explore the control flow of the complex, real-world functions in ULT as effectively as they do for the simpler problems in other datasets.\n\n#### 6.0.1. RQ1.4: Mutation Score of LLM-generated test cases\n\nFinally, we evaluate the mutation score of the test cases generated by the LLMs on ULT, PLT, and TestEval777Due to the size of PLT is very large, which requires substantial computational resources for mutation testing evaluation, we then randomly sample a subset (3,909 functions in ULT + 1,000 functions from other functions in PLT) for the mutation testing.\nThe mutation score is a measure of how well the test cases can detect faults in the code by introducing small changes (mutants) and checking if the test cases can catch them.\nAs shown in [Tab.\xa05](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.T5 "In 6.0.1. RQ1.4: Mutation Score of LLM-generated test cases ‣ 6. rq1.3 ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), the performance of LLMs on ULT is notably weaker than on the other benchmarks. On average, the M\u200bu\u200bt\u200b@\u200b5Mut@5italic\\_M italic\\_u italic\\_t @ 5 score for ULT is only 40.21%, significantly lower than the 50.80% on PLT and 49.69% on TestEval. This disparity indicates that tests generated for ULT’s complex, real-world functions are less effective at identifying potential faults compared to those for the simpler or potentially memorized problems in the other datasets.\n\nWhile generating more tests improves the score across all datasets, the low starting point for ULT highlights the underlying challenge. The average M\u200bu\u200bt\u200b@\u200b1Mut@1italic\\_M italic\\_u italic\\_t @ 1 score for ULT is a mere 20.32%, compared to 28.93% for PLT and a much higher 40.35% for TestEval. Although this low base allows for a large absolute improvement to 40.21% at M\u200bu\u200bt\u200b@\u200b5Mut@5italic\\_M italic\\_u italic\\_t @ 5 (+19.89%), the final score still lags considerably behind the other benchmarks. This pattern suggests that while multiple attempts can enhance test quality on ULT, LLMs struggle to generate a single, high-quality test, and the cumulative result remains less effective than for simpler problems.\n\n| Model Name | M\u200bu\u200bt\u200b@\u200b1Mut@1italic\\_M italic\\_u italic\\_t @ 1 | | | M\u200bu\u200bt\u200b@\u200b2Mut@2italic\\_M italic\\_u italic\\_t @ 2 | | | M\u200bu\u200bt\u200b@\u200b5Mut@5italic\\_M italic\\_u italic\\_t @ 5 | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ULT | PLT | TestEval | ULT | PLT | TestEval | ULT | PLT | TestEval |\n| Phi-4-mini-instruct | 23.84 | 28.98 | 47.18 | 29.13 (+5.29) | 37.28 (+8.30) | 51.27 (+4.09) | 36.00 (+12.16) | 47.83 (+18.85) | 54.49 (+7.31) |\n| CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf | 19.56 | 26.17 | 22.26 | 25.91 (+6.35) | 34.55 (+8.38) | 23.02 (+0.76) | 29.02 (+9.47) | 41.31 (+15.14) | 24.70 (+2.44) |\n| Seed-Coder-8B-Instruct | 25.66 | 26.18 | 56.71 | 36.96 (+11.30) | 39.61 (+13.43) | 64.99 (+8.28) | 52.04 (+26.39) | 57.30 (+31.12) | 71.25 (+14.54) |\n| gemma-3-4b-it | 10.56 | 18.89 | 41.80 | 13.62 (+3.06) | 27.69 (+8.80) | 46.28 (+4.48) | 20.92 (+10.36) | 41.38 (+22.50) | 49.01 (+7.21) |\n| gemma-3-12b-it | 26.24 | 24.63 | 56.71 | 38.33 (+12.09) | 38.50 (+13.87) | 64.99 (+8.28) | 52.68 (+26.45) | 57.74 (+33.11) | 71.25 (+14.54) |\n| gemma-3-27b-it | 21.21 | 27.57 | 34.18 | 28.36 (+7.14) | 37.73 (+10.15) | 36.68 (+2.50) | 39.91 (+18.69) | 55.00 (+27.43) | 40.35 (+6.17) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct | 16.60 | 46.06 | 23.53 | 46.35 (+29.75) | 55.11 (+9.05) | 26.96 (+3.43) | 50.39 (+33.79) | 58.86 (+12.81) | 30.91 (+7.38) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct | 22.82 | 36.36 | 41.97 | 40.70 (+17.88) | 47.08 (+10.72) | 47.31 (+5.34) | 48.84 (+26.01) | 55.81 (+19.44) | 52.72 (+10.75) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct | 24.62 | 40.99 | 56.71 | 50.23 (+25.61) | 51.00 (+10.01) | 64.99 (+8.28) | 56.33 (+31.71) | 59.57 (+18.58) | 71.25 (+14.54) |\n| deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct | 17.65 | 26.56 | 30.16 | 24.04 (+6.39) | 35.83 (+9.27) | 34.99 (+4.83) | 24.47 (+6.82) | 36.75 (+10.19) | 41.04 (+10.88) |\n| deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct | 16.91 | 19.95 | 36.46 | 25.87 (+8.95) | 32.22 (+12.27) | 44.19 (+7.73) | 37.00 (+20.09) | 50.02 (+30.06) | 51.04 (+14.58) |\n| deepseek-coder-33b-instruct | 18.13 | 24.86 | 36.55 | 25.90 (+7.77) | 34.43 (+9.57) | 38.26 (+1.71) | 34.88 (+16.74) | 48.02 (+23.16) | 38.26 (+1.71) |\n| Average | 20.32 | 28.93 | 40.35 | 32.12 (+11.80) | 39.25 (+10.32) | 45.33 (+4.98) | 40.21 (+19.89) | 50.80 (+21.86) | 49.69 (+9.34) |\n\n![Refer to caption](x1.png)\n\n### 6.1. RQ2: To what extent does the cyclomatic complexity of functions in ULT influence LLM performance compared to other benchmarks?\n\nOne of the key design goals of ULT is to provide a more rigorous evaluation of LLMs by presenting them with tasks that mirror the complexity of real-world software. To investigate whether this design goal was achieved, our RQ2 examines the extent to which code complexity impacts the performance of LLM-driven test generation. We hypothesize that the higher and more diverse complexity inherent in ULT functions poses a substantially greater challenge to LLMs compared to the more constrained, algorithmic tasks found in prior benchmarks like TestEval.\nTo quantify this, we use Cyclomatic Complexity, a well-established metric that measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program’s source code, as a proxy for structural complexity. We then correlate this metric with the achieved Branch Coverage (B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkBCov@kitalic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k) of the generated test cases across various LLMs. The evaluation results are shown in [Fig.\xa01](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.F1 "In 6.0.1. RQ1.4: Mutation Score of LLM-generated test cases ‣ 6. rq1.3 ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), which illustrates the relationship between cyclomatic complexity and branch coverage for both ULT and TestEval across multiple LLMs888We also provide the comparison of cyclomatic complexity distributions between ULT and TestEval in [Fig.\xa02](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.F2 "In 6.2.2. RQ3.2: What is the correlation between test generation performance and code generation performance? ‣ 6.2. RQ3: How does data contamination affect the assessment of test case generation? ‣ 6. rq1.3 ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions")..\n\nAs shown in [Fig.\xa01](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.F1 "In 6.0.1. RQ1.4: Mutation Score of LLM-generated test cases ‣ 6. rq1.3 ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), the first step in our analysis is to compare the distribution of cyclomatic complexity between ULT and TestEval.\nThe x-axis represents the cyclomatic complexity of the function under test, grouped into bins of 10 for ULT and 5 for TestEval to accommodate the broader range of complexities in ULT.\nWe can observe that ULT features a significantly higher and broader complexity distribution compared to TestEval.\nFor example, the cyclomatic complexity of ULT tasks spans a wide range from 10.0 to 82.0, with a mean complexity of 14.87.\nIn contrast, TestEval contains tasks that are far more constrained, with its complexity concentrated in a narrow band from 10.0 to 40.0 and a lower mean of 12.35. The cyclomatic complexity of ULT and TestEval explain the stark performance differences observed in RQ1. We also provide the cyclomatic complexity distribution of ULT and TestGenEval in [Section\xa07.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S7.SS3 "7.3. Comparison with TestGenEval ‣ 7. Discussion ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), which also shows that ULT has a wider distribution of cyclomatic complexity than TestGenEval.\n\nNext, we analyze the performance of LLMs on ULT and TestEval at equivalent levels of cyclomatic complexity.\nThis allows us to isolate the effect of task complexity from the inherent differences in task nature between the two benchmarks.\nWe focus on the cyclomatic complexity range of [10,20)[10,20)[ 10 , 20 ), where both benchmarks have a sufficient number of tasks, and we can make a direct comparison.\nThe evaluation results are shown in [Fig.\xa01](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.F1 "In 6.0.1. RQ1.4: Mutation Score of LLM-generated test cases ‣ 6. rq1.3 ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), where we can see a significant performance gap between the two benchmarks.\nFor instance, the average B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5BCov@5italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5 for CodeLlama-7B-Instruct-hf on TestEval tasks with cyclomatic complexity between 10 and 20 is close to 70%, while the average B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5BCov@5italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5 for the same model on ULT tasks in the same complexity range is lower than 30%, which means that there is a about 40% performance degradation for the same complexity level.\n\nFurthermore, we observe a clear and consistent negative correlation between increasing complexity and test generation performance within the ULT dataset itself.\nAs shown in [Fig.\xa01](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.F1 "In 6.0.1. RQ1.4: Mutation Score of LLM-generated test cases ‣ 6. rq1.3 ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), for all models, the trend line for ULT exhibits a steady decline as cyclomatic complexity grows.\nFor example, the average branch coverage (B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5BCov@5italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5) begins at 42.95% for the simplest functions (complexity [10,20)[10,20)[ 10 , 20 )) for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct. The performance then systematically degrades, dropping to 37.48% for the [20,30)[20,30)[ 20 , 30 ) bin, and falling to a mere 2.40% for highly complex functions in the [80,90)[80,90)[ 80 , 90 ) bin, which demonstrates a clear trend of performance degradation as complexity increases.\nHowever, different with the trends observed in ULT, the trend lines for TestEval usually exists a unusual performance behaviors. For example, for the [10,15)[10,15)[ 10 , 15 ) bin, the average B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5BCov@5italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5 for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct is around 91.25%, but this drops to only 87.90% for the [15,20)[15,20)[ 15 , 20 ) bin, and then further increases to 91.67% for the [25,30)[25,30)[ 25 , 30 ) bin.\n\n### 6.2. RQ3: How does data contamination affect the assessment of test case generation?\n\n#### 6.2.1. RQ3.1: How does ULT compare to PLT for the same Cyclomatic Complexity?\n\nWe’ve compared the overall performance of ULT and PLT in RQ1. To further investigate how data contamination affects the assessment result of test case generation, we control Cyclomatic Complexity and provide further analysis.\nSpecifically, we provide the B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkBCov@kitalic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k performance of the 12 LLMs on both ULT and PLT, as shown in [Fig.\xa02](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.F2 "In 6.2.2. RQ3.2: What is the correlation between test generation performance and code generation performance? ‣ 6.2. RQ3: How does data contamination affect the assessment of test case generation? ‣ 6. rq1.3 ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions")999To improve the readability, we focus on the data points with cyclomatic complexity in 99.5% percentile of the cyclomatic complexity distribution of PLT, which is [10,90)[10,90)[ 10 , 90 ), same as the complexity range of ULT..\n\nAs shown in [Fig.\xa02](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.F2 "In 6.2.2. RQ3.2: What is the correlation between test generation performance and code generation performance? ‣ 6.2. RQ3: How does data contamination affect the assessment of test case generation? ‣ 6. rq1.3 ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), we can observe that for all models, the branch coverage achieved by the generated test cases on PLT is significantly higher than on ULT, even when the cyclomatic complexity is equivalent.\nFor example, for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, the average B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5BCov@5italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5 on functions with cyclomatic complexity between 10 and 20 is over 55% on PLT, while it is only around 40% on ULT. With the increases in cyclomatic complexity, the performance gap still exists, and the branch coverage on PLT is consistently higher than on ULT.\nPLT and ULT were collected in exactly the same way by the same researchers using the same process, with only one difference: whether or not the test cases were available to LLMs for training.\nSince the only difference is whether the unit tests were leaked, the most likely explanation for the performance gap is undoubtedly that the LLMs have used the leaked unit tests in pre-training.\nThis not only inevitably leads to artificially inflated performance metric values free LM performance on the leaked data set, it allows us to empirically measure the effect size of leakage on LLM performance.\nBy contrast, the lower branch coverage on ULT suggests that the functions are more challenging and require genuine reasoning capabilities to generate effective test cases, rather than relying on memorization of previously seen test cases.\nThis confirms that our decontamination process was successful in creating a benchmark that genuinely challenges the models’ reasoning abilities rather than their capacity for memorization.\n\n#### 6.2.2. RQ3.2: What is the correlation between test generation performance and code generation performance?\n\nTo further investigate the effectiveness of ULT in assessing LLMs’ test generation capabilities, we analyze the correlation between test generation performance on ULT, TestEval, and PLT with LLMs’ code generation performance on BigCodeBench ([zhuo2024bigcodebench,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib38) ) 101010We use BigCodeBench as an established proxy for an LLM’s general coding ability. It is unsuitable as a test generation benchmark for our evaluation because its primary objective is to assess code generation from a prompt, often for tasks with lower structural complexity. In contrast, our focus is on a model’s ability to comprehend existing, complex code to achieve high path coverage, a core challenge of unit testing that requires the high cyclomatic complexity curated in our benchmark..\nAs shown in [Fig.\xa03](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.F3 "In 6.2.2. RQ3.2: What is the correlation between test generation performance and code generation performance? ‣ 6.2. RQ3: How does data contamination affect the assessment of test case generation? ‣ 6. rq1.3 ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions") left, we first analyze the correlation between test generation accuracy (p\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200b1pass@1italic\\_p italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ 1) and LLMs’ code generation performance in BigCodeBench.\nWe can observe that the results reveal a clear difference between the benchmarks. For ULT, we observe a Pearson correlation coefficient of r=0.79r=0.79italic\\_r = 0.79 (p=0.002p=0.002italic\\_p = 0.002), indicating a very strong and statistically significant positive correlation.\n\nBy contrast, the correlations for both TestEval and PLT are not statistically significant, which means there is no evidence for any correlation with the available sample of data points.\nTestEval shows a correlation of r=0.56r=0.56italic\\_r = 0.56 (p=0.059p=0.059italic\\_p = 0.059), while PLT has a correlation of r=0.52r=0.52italic\\_r = 0.52 (p=0.080p=0.080italic\\_p = 0.080).\nSince the number of data points in each sample is identical for these two benchmark suites, and for ULT, we can be confident that the correlation is much stronger for ULT and also that, if there is a correlation at all for the other two data sets, then it is considerably weaker (we would need a larger sample of data points to even precisely measure this correlation, since it is so much weaker than that we can already confidently observe for ULT).\nThe evaluation results further indicate that ULT effectively mitigates data contamination, providing a more valid evaluation of LLMs’ generalization capabilities.\nIn contrast, the weaker correlations for TestEval and PLT suggest that these benchmarks may not accurately reflect the models’ true coding abilities, as they could be influenced by memorization of training data or other artifacts.\n\nNext, we extend our analysis to code coverage metrics, which provide a deeper understanding of the quality of generated tests beyond mere correctness. For line coverage (l\u200bc\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b1lcov@1italic\\_l italic\\_c italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 1), we can observe that ULT exhibits a moderately strong and significant correlation with code generation performance (r=0.66r=0.66italic\\_r = 0.66, p=0.019p=0.019italic\\_p = 0.019).\nHowever, for PLT, the correlation is weak and not statistically significant (r=0.26r=0.26italic\\_r = 0.26, p=0.409p=0.409italic\\_p = 0.409), which indicates that LLMs try to memorize existing test cases from their training data to achieve high line coverage on these functions.\nSimilar to the line coverage, we also analyze the correlation of branch coverage (b\u200bc\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b1bcov@1italic\\_b italic\\_c italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 1) with code generation ability.\nAs shown in [Fig.\xa03](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S6.F3 "In 6.2.2. RQ3.2: What is the correlation between test generation performance and code generation performance? ‣ 6.2. RQ3: How does data contamination affect the assessment of test case generation? ‣ 6. rq1.3 ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), ULT maintains a strong positive correlation with coding ability (r=0.77r=0.77italic\\_r = 0.77, p=0.004p=0.004italic\\_p = 0.004), which shows that for unseen and complex functions, stronger models are significantly better at navigating intricate logic to cover more branches.\nFor the PLT, the correlation is almost negligible (r=0.22r=0.22italic\\_r = 0.22, p=0.492p=0.492italic\\_p = 0.492), indicating that LLMs can achieve high branch coverage on these functions without necessarily understanding the underlying logic, likely due to the memorization of existing test cases from their training data.\n\n![Refer to caption](x2.png)\n![Refer to caption](x3.png)\n\n## 7. Discussion\n\n### 7.1. Impact of Iterative Query Count on Benchmark Suitability\n\nTo understand how the number of iterative queries (kkitalic\\_k) affects the performance of LLMs on ULT and TestEval, we conducted a detailed analysis of performance trends as kkitalic\\_k was varied from 1 to 20. The evaluation results, shown in [Fig.\xa04](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S7.F4 "In 7.1. Impact of Iterative Query Count on Benchmark Suitability ‣ 7. Discussion ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), highlight two critical and divergent patterns between ULT and TestEval.\n\n![Refer to caption](x4.png)\n\nFirst, as shown in [Fig.\xa04](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S7.F4 "In 7.1. Impact of Iterative Query Count on Benchmark Suitability ‣ 7. Discussion ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), we observe a significant difference in how code coverage evolves on the two benchmarks.\nOn TestEval, both line and branch coverage exhibit rapid initial growth and then quickly converge towards a plateau.\nFor instance, powerful models like Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieve nearly 95% line coverage after generating just 8-10 test cases, with subsequent tests yielding diminishing returns.\nThis saturation indicates that the underlying functions in TestEval are structurally simple, possessing a limited number of execution paths that are easily exhausted by a small set of tests.\nConsequently, TestEval has a low ceiling for evaluation, making it less suitable for assessing an LLM’s ability to generate a truly comprehensive and diverse test suite over extended interactions.\nIn contrast, code coverage on ULT demonstrates a sustained growth trajectory as kkitalic\\_k increases.\nEven after generating 20 distinct test cases, the total line and branch coverage for all models remains below 60%.\nThis pattern strongly suggests that the functions within ULT are significantly more complex, containing a large number of independent execution paths that require continuous generation of novel test inputs to be explored.\nThe lack of a coverage plateau provides a much longer and more discerning runway for evaluation.\nIt allows for a clearer differentiation between models based on their ability to consistently reason about complex code and diversify their test generation strategies over time.\nThis characteristic validates ULT as a more challenging and appropriate benchmark for rigorously measuring the test generation capabilities of advanced LLMs.\n\nThe second observation is the divergent trend in test accuracy (P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200bkPass@kitalic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ italic\\_k) between the two benchmarks, as shown in [Fig.\xa04](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S7.F4 "In 7.1. Impact of Iterative Query Count on Benchmark Suitability ‣ 7. Discussion ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions").\nOn ULT, the accuracy of generated tests remains relatively low but stable across all values of kkitalic\\_k.\nThis behavior is consistent with models confronting a genuinely difficult and unseen task; their ability to produce a correct test does not significantly degrade as they are asked for more examples.\nConversely, on TestEval, we observe a sharp and consistent decay in accuracy as kkitalic\\_k increases.\nFor example, the accuracy for deepseek-coder-33b-instruct plummets from an initial 72.86% at k=1k=1italic\\_k = 1 to 42.55% at k=20k=20italic\\_k = 20.\nWe hypothesize that this accuracy degradation is a direct symptom of data contamination within the TestEval benchmark.\nIn the initial query (k=1k=1italic\\_k = 1), LLMs are likely to retrieve and output a memorized solution—the “leaked” test case they have seen during pre-training.\nAt this stage, the evaluation is primarily measuring the model’s memorization ability, resulting in an inflated accuracy score.\nHowever, as the iterative process continues, the prompt explicitly requires the LLM to generate a test case that is different from the ones it has already provided.\nThis constraint forces the model to move beyond simple recall and engage in genuine test case generation.\nAt this point, the task transitions from a test of memory to a true test of reasoning and generalization.\nThe subsequent, significant drop in accuracy reflects the model’s actual, and much lower, capability for this more complex task.\nThis phenomenon underscores the critical importance of our decontamination process and validates that ULT provides a more faithful and realistic assessment of an LLM’s test generation skills.\n\n### 7.2. Query Strategy\n\nIn our experiments, to ensure that LLMs generate diverse test cases that can achieve high coverage, we requires LLMs to generate multiple test cases iteratively, with the instruction to produce a new test case that is “different” from the previous ones.\nTo explore the effectiveness of this strategy, we compare it against a more simpler approach where the model is simply asked to generate a test case for each query without any additional guidance. To avoid LLM repeat its previous test cases, we adjust the temperature to 0.2, which encourages the model to produce diverse outputs while still allowing it to generate valid test cases.\nThe evaluation results are shown in [Tab.\xa06](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S7.T6 "In 7.2. Query Strategy ‣ 7. Discussion ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), we can observe that our feedback-driven query strategy (w/ Feedback) significantly outperforms the way where LLMs are simply asked to generate different test cases (w/o Feedback) across all metrics and models.\nFor example, for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, the line coverage (L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5LCov@5italic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5) improved from 16.65% to 21.32% with feedback, a gain of +4.67%, while the improvement of line coverage without feedback was only +1.08%.\nSimilarly, the branch coverage (B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200b5BCov@5italic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ 5) increased from 9.05% to 15.91% with feedback, a gain of +6.86%, while the improvement without feedback was only +1.62%.\nThis trend is consistent across both models and all metrics, indicating that the feedback-driven query strategy is significantly more effective in guiding LLMs to generate high-quality test cases that cover more lines and branches of the code under test.\n\n| Model Name | Strategy | Test Accuracy (P\u200ba\u200bs\u200bs\u200b@\u200bkPass@kitalic\\_P italic\\_a italic\\_s italic\\_s @ italic\\_k) | | | Line Coverage (L\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkLCov@kitalic\\_L italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k) | | | Branch Coverage (B\u200bC\u200bo\u200bv\u200b@\u200bkBCov@kitalic\\_B italic\\_C italic\\_o italic\\_v @ italic\\_k) | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| k=1k=1italic\\_k = 1 | k=2k=2italic\\_k = 2 | k=5k=5italic\\_k = 5 | k=1k=1italic\\_k = 1 | k=2k=2italic\\_k = 2 | k=5k=5italic\\_k = 5 | k=1k=1italic\\_k = 1 | k=2k=2italic\\_k = 2 | k=5k=5italic\\_k = 5 |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct | w/o Feedback | 5.45 | 5.26 | 5.08 | 17.04 | 17.58 (+0.54) | 18.12 (+1.08) | 9.45 | 10.20 (+0.75) | 11.07 (+1.62) |\n| w/ Feedback | 5.81 | 6.06 | 6.42 | 16.65 | 18.77 (+2.12) | 21.32 (+4.67) | 9.05 | 12.00 (+2.95) | 15.91 (+6.86) |\n| deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct | w/o Feedback | 4.14 | 3.39 | 2.63 | 9.93 | 10.31 (+0.38) | 10.57 (+0.64) | 5.17 | 5.70 (+0.53) | 6.06 (+0.89) |\n| w/ Feedback | 4.02 | 3.82 | 3.73 | 9.94 | 11.40 (+1.46) | 12.96 (+3.02) | 5.23 | 7.22 (+1.99) | 9.52 (+4.29) |\n\n### 7.3. Comparison with TestGenEval\n\nTo further validate the complexity and realism of ULT, we compared its cyclomatic complexity distribution with that of TestGenEval ([jain2024testgeneval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib6) ), another recent benchmark for test generation.\nAs shown in [Tab.\xa07](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S7.T7 "In 7.3. Comparison with TestGenEval ‣ 7. Discussion ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions"), we can observe that ULT has a significantly higher cyclomatic complexity range, with a mean complexity of 14.87 and a maximum of 82, compared to TestGenEval’s mean complexity of 4.71 and maximum of 35.\nThis indicates that ULT contains more complex functions that require advanced reasoning capabilities to generate effective test cases.\nFurthermore, the cyclomatic complexity of ULT is concentrated in a narrower range, with 100% of its functions having a cyclomatic complexity of 10 or higher, while TestGenEval has 87.3% of its functions with a cyclomatic complexity of 9 or less.\nThis further supports our claim that ULT provides a more challenging and realistic benchmark for function-level unit test generation, as it requires LLMs to navigate complex logic and cover multiple execution paths within individual functions, rather than simply generating tests for larger files with lower complexity.\n\n| Benchmark | Range | ¡ 10 | ¿=10 | Mean | Median | Min | Max |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ULT | 10-82 | 0 | 100 | 14.87 | 12 | 10 | 82 |\n| TestGenEval | 0-35 | 87.3 | 12.7 | 4.71 | 3 | 1 | 35 |\n\n### 7.4. Avoiding Future Data Contamination\n\nA critical challenge for any contemporary benchmark is ensuring its long-term viability in an era where public data is continuously scraped for training next-generation LLMs.\nThis process of data contamination or leakage, where a model is inadvertently trained on the benchmark it is meant to be evaluated against, can invalidate results and obscure true scientific progress.\nWe have designed the release and evaluation process for ULT specifically to mitigate this threat.\n\nOur primary strategy is to separate the benchmark’s problems from its solutions.\nWe publicly release the curated set of 3,909 Python functions that serve as the evaluation problems.\nHowever, we deliberately withhold the ground-truth test suites that we created for our internal validation.\nThese reference tests are not required for evaluation.\nInstead, we provide a self-contained evaluation script.\nResearchers use this script to evaluate the tests generated by their models; the script dynamically executes the generated tests against the functions-under-test and calculates metrics, such as line and branch coverage, without ever exposing a static set of correct solutions that could be crawled and memorized by future models.\nThis approach ensures that ULT remains a robust test of generation capability, not memorization.\n\nThis design also addresses the secondary threat of adversarial contamination, where a user might generate their own high-quality tests and add them to public corpora.\nWhile this is impossible to prevent entirely, our approach makes such contamination significantly more difficult and less direct than if we had provided a canonical golden set of tests ourselves.\nFurthermore, to foster a community-wide commitment to the benchmark’s integrity, the license for ULT will explicitly discourage users from making generated test suites publicly available in a manner that facilitates web crawling.\nWe believe establishing this community norm is crucial for preserving the benchmark’s value, balancing the principles of open science and replicability with the practical need for contamination-resistant evaluation.\n\n### 7.5. Threats to Validity\n\n#### 7.5.1. Internal Validity\n\nInternal validity concerns potential confounding factors within our experimental setup that could influence the observed outcomes.\nA primary threat pertains to the reproducibility and determinism of the test cases generated by LLMs.\nThe inherently stochastic nature of some decoding strategies could lead to variability in results, making it difficult to attribute performance differences solely to model capabilities.\nTo mitigate this, we employed a greedy decoding strategy by setting the temperature parameter to 0 for all experiments, as detailed in [Section\xa04.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S4.SS3 "4.3. Inference Configuration ‣ 4. Experiment Design ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions").\nThis approach significantly minimizes randomness, ensuring that the generated outputs are as deterministic as possible and primarily reflect the model’s core reasoning abilities rather than sampling artifacts. Another potential threat is the reliability of our test execution and evaluation environment.\nInconsistencies in the environment, such as differing library versions or system configurations, could lead to spurious test failures or inaccurate coverage measurements.\nTo address this, all generated test cases were executed within a unified and standardized Docker environment.\nThis containerized setup guarantees that every test is run against the exact same version of the Python interpreter and dependent libraries, thereby ensuring the consistency and comparability of our results across all models and benchmarks.\n\n#### 7.5.2. External Validity\n\nExternal validity relates to the generalizability of our findings beyond the specific context of this study.\nOne threat is the representativeness of our benchmark.\nAlthough ULT is constructed from a large corpus of real-world Python functions from The Stack v2 and curated based on specific criteria like cyclomatic complexity and test case decontamination, it may not encompass the full spectrum of programming paradigms, application domains, or coding styles found in all software projects.\nTherefore, while our results provide strong evidence regarding complex, self-contained functions, caution should be exercised when generalizing them to other types of software, such as large-scale enterprise systems or highly specialized domains.\nAnother threat to external validity is our focus on a single programming language, Python.\nThe capabilities of LLMs in code understanding and generation can vary across different languages due to differences in syntax, semantics, and representation in their training data.\nThe findings and performance gaps observed in this study for Python may not directly translate to other languages like Java, C++, or JavaScript.\nFinally, our evaluation is limited to the specific set of 12 LLMs listed in [Tab.\xa01](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#S4.T1 "In 4.2.1. Evaluation LLMs ‣ 4.2. Models and Baselines ‣ 4. Experiment Design ‣ Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions").\nThe field of LLMs is evolving at an exceptionally rapid pace, with new and more powerful models being released frequently.\nWhile our selection represents a broad and diverse snapshot of the current state-of-the-art, our specific findings may not be generalizable to future, more advanced models that may overcome some of the challenges identified in this work.\n\n#### 7.5.3. Construct Validity\n\nConstruct validity examines whether our evaluation metrics and experimental design accurately measure the concepts they purport to assess, namely test generation quality and a model’s reasoning capability.\nA potential threat is our reliance on code coverage (line and branch) and mutation score as primary proxies for the quality of a generated test suite.\nWhile these are standard and widely accepted metrics in software testing research, they are not perfect.\nHigh coverage does not guarantee the absence of bugs, and a test suite could kill many mutants without necessarily reflecting all aspects of real-world fault-finding effectiveness.\nNonetheless, these metrics provide a quantitative, objective, and reproducible basis for comparison that is standard practice in the field.\nAnother threat lies in our use of performance on BigCodeBench as a proxy for an LLM’s intrinsic, general-purpose coding ability in our RQ3 analysis.\nWhile BigCodeBench is a comprehensive benchmark, a model’s proficiency in general code generation may not perfectly correlate with its specialized ability to perform test generation, which requires different reasoning skills (e.g., identifying edge cases and defining assertions).\nHowever, by using a well-established, independent benchmark, we establish a reasonable baseline for a model’s fundamental reasoning capabilities, allowing us to effectively test our hypothesis regarding data contamination.\nFinally, the design of our iterative test generation task, where we prompt for a “new” and “distinct” test case in each round, could be a threat.\nThe interpretation of these terms by the LLM might vary, and the prompt structure itself could influence the diversification strategy of the models.\nWe acknowledge this as an inherent aspect of using natural language to prompt LLMs and have kept the prompt consistent across all models to ensure a fair comparison.\n\n## 8. Related Work\n\nOur research is situated within the rapidly growing field of applying LLMs to the software engineering task of automated test generation.\nThis area has seen a surge of innovation, with researchers exploring various strategies to leverage the code and reasoning capabilities of LLMs.\nThis section reviews the literature by first surveying the landscape of LLM-based test generation techniques and then discussing the evolution of benchmarks used to evaluate them, thereby positioning the unique contribution of ULT.\n\n### 8.1. LLMs for Test Generation\n\nThe application of LLMs to generate unit tests has evolved from initial feasibility studies to a variety of sophisticated techniques aimed at improving the quality and effectiveness of the generated test suites.\nThese approaches can be broadly categorized by whether they focus on refining the model’s input (prompt engineering), enhancing the model’s output (post-processing and repair), or altering the generation process itself.\nA foundational stream of research has focused on empirically evaluating the baseline performance of LLMs and building practical tools.\nStudies by Siddiq et al. ([siddiq2024using,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib39) ), Schäfer et al. ([schafer2023empirical,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib3) ), and El Haji et al. ([el2024using,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib40) ) provided crucial early insights into the capabilities and limitations of models like Codex, GPT-3.5, and GitHub Copilot for generating tests in languages such as Java, JavaScript, and Python.\nThis foundational work paved the way for IDE plugins like TestSpark ([sapozhnikov2024testspark,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib41) ), which integrate test generation directly into the developer’s workflow.\nOther work has focused on optimizing the input to the LLM to elicit higher-quality outputs.\nResearchers have shown that careful prompt engineering, such as providing contextual information about the code or its dependencies, can significantly improve the quality of generated tests ([bareiss2022code,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib42) ; huang2024measuring).\nMore advanced techniques employ retrieval-augmented generation, where relevant few-shot examples are dynamically retrieved from a corpus and included in the prompt to guide the model, as demonstrated by CEDAR ([nashid2023retrieval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib43) ).\nRecognizing that LLMs often produce imperfect or incomplete tests, another major line of work focuses on enhancing or repairing the generated output.\nThis includes hybrid approaches that combine LLMs with traditional software testing techniques.\nFor instance, Codamosa ([lemieux2023codamosa,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib44) ) uses LLMs to generate new test inputs to help Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) escape from local optima and improve coverage.\nOther techniques focus on iterative refinement, where the LLM’s output is executed, and the resulting feedback (e.g., compilation errors, failed assertions) is used to prompt the model for a revised solution, a strategy employed by Testart ([gu2024testart,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib45) ) in a co-evolutionary cycle.\nGuidance from external analysis is also common, with researchers using static analysis ([pan2025aster,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib46) ) or feedback from mutation testing ([dakhel2024effective,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib47) ) to guide the LLM toward producing more effective and bug-finding tests.\nAlthough these techniques have shown promising results in test generation, there still lack a comprehensive benchmark that can effectively evaluate the true reasoning and generalization capabilities of LLMs in this context.\nOur work addresses this gap by introducing ULT, a benchmark specifically designed to challenge LLMs with complex, real-world functions while mitigating the risks of data contamination and ensuring a more accurate assessment of their test generation abilities.\n\n### 8.2. Benchmarks for Test Generation\n\nConcurrent with the development of new generation techniques has been the creation of benchmarks to evaluate their effectiveness.\nAn early and influential benchmark, TestEval ([wang2024testeval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib5) ), established a foundation by proposing tasks based on competitive programming problems from LeetCode.\nIt introduced key evaluation metrics, including coverage-oriented tasks and the use of mutation scores, providing a standardized basis for comparing LLMs.\nHowever, as we demonstrated in our study, its reliance on algorithmic problems limits its representativeness of real-world software engineering challenges.\nSubsequent benchmarks sought to improve real-world relevance by sourcing tasks from large, open-source software projects.\nSWT-Bench ([mundler2024swt,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib20) ) and TestGenEval ([jain2024testgeneval,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib6) ) both derive their tasks from the SWE-Bench dataset ([jimenez2023swe,](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00408v1#bib.bib22) ).\nSWT-Bench frames the task as issue reproduction, where the goal is to generate a test that fails on buggy code but passes on the fixed version.\nTestGenEval focuses on test file generation and completion, using execution-based metrics on code from major software repositories.\nWhile these benchmarks marked a significant step towards realism, they introduced other confounding factors that ULT is explicitly designed to address.\nAs discussed in our introduction and supported by our findings in RQ3, benchmarks derived from popular public repositories are susceptible to test case contamination, where models may score well by recalling solutions from their training data rather than by demonstrating genuine reasoning.\nFurthermore, their file- or repository-level task granularity often leads to excessively long input contexts, which can degrade LLM performance, and their tasks may not consistently feature high structural complexity.\nULT differentiates itself from this prior work by simultaneously ensuring real-world relevance, mitigating test case contamination through a rigorous filtering process, controlling for complexity by filtering on cyclomatic complexity, and utilizing a function-level focus to enable a more precise assessment of an LLM’s core test generation capabilities.\n\n## 9. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduce ULT, a new benchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from real-world Python functions.\nULT is designed to address critical limitations in existing benchmarks, such as test case data contamination and insufficient program complexity.\nBy focusing on real-world functions with high cyclomatic complexity, ULT provides a more challenging and realistic evaluation environment for LLMs.\nWe also provide PLT, a pair benchmarks of ULT with leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization versus reasoning in test generation.\nWe conducted a comprehensive experimental evaluation involving 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, systematically comparing their performance on ULT against other benchmarks like TestEval, BigCodeBench, and PLT.\nOur findings reveal that ULT significantly outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of complexity and challenge, with a broader distribution of cyclomatic complexity ranging from 10.0 to 82.0 and a mean of 14.87, compared to TestEval’s concentration between 9.0 to 45.0, with a mean of 12.35.\nWe also demonstrated that performance on ULT is substantially lower across all metrics (accuracy, line coverage, and branch coverage) compared to TestEval and PLT, confirming that its tasks are inherently more difficult.\nFor example, test cases generated by LLMs only achieve 41.32%, 45.10%, 30.22%, and 40.21% for accuracy, statement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all LLMs, respectively. These results are substantially lower than the corresponding metrics on TestEval (91.79%, 92.18%, 82.04%, and 49.69%) and PLT (47.07%, 55.13%, 40.07%, and 50.80%).\nThis performance gap persists even when comparing tasks of similar cyclomatic complexity, indicating that ULT’s tasks are not only more complex but also require deeper reasoning and generalization capabilities from the models.\n\n## References\n\n![Mascot Sammy](data:image/png;base64,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)'), SearchResult(url='https://www.turing.com/resources/understanding-llm-evaluation-and-benchmarks', title='A Complete Guide to LLM Evaluation and Benchmarking - Turing', raw_content='A Complete Guide to LLM Evaluation and Benchmarking\n\n[![logo](/assets/Turing-Wordmark_White.svg)](/)\n\nWhat we do\n\nTuring AGI Advancement\n\n[![LLM evaluation](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fturing.cdn.prismic.io%2Fturing%2FZqC6-B5LeNNTxcos_Model_assessment.svg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%2Cformat&w=48&q=75)\n\nLLM evaluation\n\nComprehensive model performance, accuracy, and scalability assessment.](/services/llm-model-evaluation)[![LLM training](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fturing.cdn.prismic.io%2Fturing%2FZe_L1UmNsf2sHgvr_FoundationalModels_LLM.svg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%2Cformat&w=48&q=75)\n\nLLM training\n\nLLM reasoning, coding, and knowledge improvement with proprietary human data.](/services/llm-training-and-development)[![Multimodality](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fturing.cdn.prismic.io%2Fturing%2FZtr4oRoQrfVKlyih_PAGE7__MULTIMODALITY_80X80_WHITE.svg&w=48&q=75)\n\nMultimodality\n\nIntegrate text, images, and videos for human-like intelligence.](/services/llm-multimodality)[![LLM factuality](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fturing.cdn.prismic.io%2Fturing%2FZtr4oBoQrfVKlyig_PAGE7__FACTUALITY_80X80_WHITE.svg&w=48&q=75)\n\nLLM factuality\n\nAdvanced fact verification, bias detection, and source credibility assessment.](/services/llm-factuality)[![LLM alignment & safety](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fturing.cdn.prismic.io%2Fturing%2FZtr4nxoQrfVKlyif_PAGE7__ALIGMENTANDSAFETY_80X80_WHITE.svg&w=48&q=75)\n\nLLM alignment & safety\n\nBias mitigation, RLHF integration, safety protocols, and more.](/services/llm-alignment-and-safety)\n\nTuring Intelligence\n\n[![Generative AI](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fturing.cdn.prismic.io%2Fturing%2FZe_L1kmNsf2sHgvs_GenAI.svg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%2Cformat&w=48&q=75)\n\nGenerative AI\n\nCustomizable genAI products and solutions for the enterprise.](/services/generative-ai)[![AI/Data](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fturing.cdn.prismic.io%2Fturing%2FZe_Lz0mNsf2sHgvl_AI_ML.svg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%2Cformat&w=48&q=75)\n\nAI/Data\n\nAccelerated AI adoption, optimized ML operations, and more.](/services/ai)[![Custom engineering](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fturing.cdn.prismic.io%2Fturing%2FZe_L2kmNsf2sHgvw_More.svg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%2Cformat&w=48&q=75)\n\nCustom engineering\n\nApplication development, cloud migration, and other solutions.](/services/custom-engineering)\n\nFeatured resource\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.prismic.io%2Fturing%2Fbaf2d5b4-2053-488f-aab8-8b74cfa3cd7b_Fine-tuning%2BLLMs%2BHero.jpg%3Fauto%3Dformat%2Ccompress&w=384&q=75)\n\nFine-Tuning LLMs: Overview, Methods, and Best Practices\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have transformed the field of natural language processing with their advanced capabilities and highly sophisticated solutions.

[Wrapping up](/resources/understanding-llm-evaluation-and-benchmarks#wrapping-up)\n\nAs large language models (LLMs) become integral to business workflows, ensuring their reliability and efficiency is crucial. As a result, the importance of deploying robust evaluation and benchmarking techniques for successful model implementation cannot be understated.\n\nLLMs are assessed on various tasks, including language generation, translation, reasoning, summarization, question-answering, and relevance. Comprehensive evaluations help build robust and secure models across different dimensions while detecting any regressions over time.\n\n## What is LLM evaluation?\n\n![Fundamentals of LLM evaluation](https://images.prismic.io/turing/ZfLAR0mNsf2sHkok_FundamentalsofLLMevaluation.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nLLM evaluation involves measuring and assessing a model\'s performance across key tasks. This process uses various metrics to determine how well the model predicts or generates text, understands context, summarizes data, and responds to queries. Evaluation is crucial for identifying a model\'s strengths and weaknesses, offering insights for improvement, and guiding the [fine-tuning](https://www.turing.com/resources/finetuning-large-language-models) process.\n\n### Types of evaluation: Model evaluation vs. system evaluation\n\nWhen evaluating LLMs, it\'s important to distinguish between two primary types: model evaluation and system evaluation. Both are vital for assessing an LLM\'s overall effectiveness, though they focus on different aspects.\n\n#### Model evaluation\n\nModel evaluation focuses on the internal capabilities and performance of the LLM itself. It examines how well the model performs specific tasks like text generation, language understanding, translation, and summarization. This evaluation typically includes:\n\n- **Intrinsic metrics:** These metrics assess the model\'s fundamental properties, such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and F1 score, which help gauge its ability to generate coherent, relevant, and grammatically correct text.\n- **Fine-tuning and validation:** This involves evaluating the model during and after fine-tuning on specific datasets to ensure it generalizes well and produces accurate results consistent with the training data.\n\n#### System evaluation\n\nSystem evaluation focuses on the LLM’s performance within a larger system or application, assessing its effectiveness in real-world scenarios and its integration with other components like user interfaces, databases, and external APIs. This evaluation typically involves:\n\n- **Extrinsic metrics:** These metrics measure the system’s overall performance in completing end-to-end tasks, such as accurately answering user queries, performing sentiment analysis, or generating reports in a production environment.\n- **User experience and usability:** This aspect considers how intuitive and responsive the system is when interacting with the LLM, evaluating factors like latency, scalability, and user satisfaction.\n- **Robustness and reliability:** This involves testing the model’s robustness against diverse inputs, including edge cases, noisy data, and unexpected queries, ensuring the system remains reliable under varying conditions.\n\nBy incorporating both model and system evaluations, companies can develop AI systems that are not only technically proficient but also practical and user-friendly.\n\n## How does your LLM stack up against the best?\n\nUnderstanding model vs. system evaluation is just the first step.

Below are the key criteria essential for assessing the performance and reliability of LLMs across different use cases:\n\n- **Response completeness and conciseness:** Ensures the LLM\'s output is thorough and free of redundancy.\n- **Text similarity metrics:** Assess how closely the generated text aligns with a reference text, focusing on the accuracy and fidelity of the output.\n- **Question answering accuracy:** Measures the LLM’s ability to provide correct and relevant answers to specific questions, ensuring precision and contextual understanding.\n- **Relevance:** Evaluates how well the generated content aligns with the context or query, ensuring that the response is pertinent and appropriate.\n- **Hallucination index:** Tracks the frequency with which the LLM generates information not present in the source data or that is [factually incorrect](https://www.turing.com/resources/minimize-llm-hallucinations-strategy).\n- **Toxicity:** Assesses the model\'s output for harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content, ensuring safe and responsible usage.\n- **Task-specific metrics:** Involves specialized metrics tailored to the specific application of the LLM, such as BLEU for translation or ROUGE for summarization, to measure performance in those particular tasks.\n- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):** Measures the effectiveness of the system in retrieving relevant documents and the accuracy and relevance of the final generated answer based on those documents.\n\n### Key metrics for LLM evaluation\n\nSeveral metrics are commonly used to evaluate LLM performance, each providing unique insights into different aspects of model output:\n\n- **BLEU (Bilingual evaluation understudy):** Often used for machine translation, BLEU calculates the overlap of n-grams (a contiguous sequence of n items from a given text sample) between the model’s output and a set of human-written reference translations. A higher BLEU score indicates better text generation, as the output closely resembles the reference. However, BLEU has limitations, such as its inability to evaluate semantic meaning or the relevance of the generated text.\n- **MoverScore**: A more recent metric designed to measure semantic similarity between two pieces of text. MoverScore uses Word Mover’s Distance, calculating the minimum distance that words in one text need to “travel” to match the distribution of words in another. It then adjusts this distance based on the importance of different words to the text’s overall meaning. MoverScore provides a nuanced evaluation of semantic similarity, but it’s computationally intensive and may not always align with human judgment.\n- **Perplexity**: It quantifies how well a model predicts a sample, typically a piece of text. A lower perplexity score indicates better performance in predicting the next word in a sequence. While useful for quantitative assessment, perplexity doesn’t account for qualitative aspects like coherence or relevance and is often paired with other metrics for a more robust evaluation.\n- **Exact match:** Commonly used in question-answering and machine translation, exact match measures the percentage of predictions that exactly match reference answers. While helpful in gauging accuracy, it doesn’t consider near misses or semantic similarity, making it necessary to use it alongside other, more nuanced metrics.\n- **Precision**: It measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive observations. In LLMs, precision reflects the fraction of correct predictions over the total number of predictions made by the model. A high precision score indicates the model is likely correct when it makes a prediction. However, precision doesn’t account for relevant predictions the model might have missed (false negatives), so it’s often combined with recall for a balanced evaluation.\n- **Recall**: Also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, recall measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model. A high recall score indicates the model’s efficiency in detecting relevant information, but it doesn’t account for irrelevant predictions (false positives). Therefore, recall is often paired with precision for a comprehensive assessment.\n- **F1 score:** The F1 score is a popular metric that balances precision and recall by calculating their harmonic mean—a specific type of average that penalizes extremes more heavily than the arithmetic mean. A high F1 score indicates that the model maintains a good balance between precision and recall, making it particularly useful when both false positives and false negatives are important considerations. The F1 score ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n- **ROUGE (Recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation)**: ROUGE is widely used for tasks like text summarization and has several variants:\n\na. **ROUGE-N** measures the overlap of n-grams between the generated text and the reference text. The formula for ROUGE-N is:\n\n![ROUGE-N metric formula](https://images.prismic.io/turing/Zt57YxoQrfVKl1XH_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nHere’s what each term represents:\n\n- **Match(n-gram):** The maximum number of N-grams co-occurring in a candidate text and a set of reference texts.\n- **Count(n-gram):** The total count of N-grams in the reference summaries.\n\nb. **ROUGE-L** focuses on the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the generated and reference texts, evaluating overall coherence. The formula for ROUGE-L is:\n\n![ROUGE-L metric formula](https://images.prismic.io/turing/Zt57YhoQrfVKl1XG_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams-1-.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nFor example, if the LCS between the candidate and reference summary is 4 words, and the total number of words in the reference summary is 9 words, then ROUGE-L would be calculated as:\n\n![ROUGE-L metric formula](https://images.prismic.io/turing/Zt57YRoQrfVKl1XE_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams-2-.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nc. **ROUGE-S** assesses the overlap of skip-bigrams (two words in order, regardless of the number of words in between) between the texts, which is useful for evaluating the model\'s language flexibility.\n\nEach ROUGE variant offers specific insights but should be used alongside other evaluation methods for a comprehensive assessment.\n\n### Human evaluation parameters\n\nHuman evaluation metrics are vital for assessing the model\'s performance from a qualitative perspective, something that automated metrics might not fully capture. Human evaluators review and rate the model outputs on various aspects such as coherence, relevance, and fluency.   \nUnlike automated metrics that provide immediate, quantitative feedback, human evaluations offer nuanced insights into how well a model\'s output aligns with human judgment and expectations. While this evaluation method can be more time-consuming, it remains essential for a comprehensive LLM evaluation strategy.\n\n## Automated versus human evaluation\n\nAutomated and human evaluations serve distinct yet complementary roles in assessing LLMs. Automated evaluations provide quick, quantitative measures of a model\'s performance by using metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity. However, they may miss nuances and qualitative aspects of the output.   \nOn the other hand, human evaluations capture these nuances by assessing the output coherence, relevance, and fluency. However, a balanced evaluation strategy often combines both automated and human evaluations, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the model\'s performance.\n\n## Benchmarks in LLM training\n\nLLM benchmarks are standard datasets and tasks widely adopted by the research community to assess and compare the performance of various models. These benchmarks include predefined splits for training, validation, and testing, along with established evaluation metrics and protocols.   \nBenchmarks provide a common ground for systematically comparing different models and approaches, assessing progress by setting challenges that models must meet or exceed. While metrics directly assess model output, benchmarks offer a standardized context for understanding the significance of these metrics in terms of progress or capability.\n\n### Prominent benchmarks used for LLM performance measurement\n\nSeveral benchmarks are widely used in the industry to evaluate and quantify LLM performance and relevance. Some of the most prominent LLM benchmarks include:\n\n- **GLUE (general language understanding evaluation):**\xa0 GLUE provides a comprehensive baseline to evaluate and compare model performance across various natural language understanding tasks, such as sentiment analysis, textual entailment, and sentence similarity. By offering a diverse set of challenges, GLUE measures a model\'s ability to understand context, infer meaning, and process language at a level comparable to humans.   \n  This benchmark helps identify LLM strengths and weaknesses, driving progress in natural language processing (NLP) research by encouraging the development of more robust and versatile models.\n- **MMLU (massive multitask language understanding)**:\xa0 MMLU is a challenging LLM benchmark designed to assess the depth of a model’s understanding across a broad spectrum of subjects. It presents models with tasks derived from various domains, including humanities, social sciences, history, computer science, and law. MMLU gauges the breadth of a model\'s knowledge and its capacity for complex reasoning, contextual understanding, and transfer learning.   \n  This benchmark is pivotal in developing LLMs capable of generating contextual text across diverse domains, though it\'s important to note that MMLU is sensitive to how it’s implemented.\n- **DeepEval**: DeepEval is an open-source framework designed to simplify the evaluation of LLMs, enabling easy iteration and development of LLM applications.

Current LLM evaluation benchmarks face several challenges and limitations:\n\n- **Influence of prompts:** Performance metrics may be sensitive to specific prompts, potentially masking the actual capabilities of the model.\n- **Construct validity:** Establishing acceptable answers for diverse use cases is challenging because of the broad spectrum of tasks involved.\n- **Insufficient standardization:** The lack of standardized benchmarks leads researchers and experts to use varying benchmarks and implementations, resulting in inconsistent and sometimes incomparable evaluation results.\n- **Human evaluations:** While essential for capturing qualitative aspects, human evaluations are time-consuming, expensive, and potentially inconsistent, which can hinder the efficiency of tasks requiring subjective judgment, such as abstractive summaries.\n- **Data diversity and representativeness:** Many benchmarks may not fully capture the variety of languages, dialects, cultural contexts, or specialized knowledge that LLMs may encounter in practical applications. This can lead to models that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail in more diverse or niche environments.\n- **Handling biases and ethical concerns:** Identifying and mitigating biased outputs is a significant challenge, as is understanding the underlying causes of these biases. Additionally, the ethical implications of deploying LLMs in sensitive domains require careful consideration during the evaluation process.\n- **Ensuring robustness and generalization:** It’s critical to test models against a wide array of scenarios, including rare or unexpected situations in real-world applications. Ensuring that LLMs can handle these situations without performance degradation is essential for their reliable deployment.\n- **Prioritizing the right evaluation benchmarks:** With the growing number of evaluation methods and tools, organizations often struggle to select the most relevant benchmarks, leading to either over-evaluating, which is resource-intensive, or under-evaluating, missing critical insights. Expert guidance is needed to navigate this landscape and choose the benchmarks that best align with specific goals and use cases.\n\n## Key considerations for effective LLM evaluation protocols\n\nDefining effective evaluation protocols is essential for creating a robust framework that accurately assesses the performance and utility of LLMs. These protocols should incorporate a mix of automated and human evaluations, diverse benchmarks, and [ethical considerations](https://www.turing.com/resources/implementing-security-guardrails-for-llms).\n\n![Defining effective evaluation protocols](https://images.prismic.io/turing/ZfLQSUmNsf2sHkvm_Definingeffectiveevaluationprotocols.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\nTailoring these protocols to the specific use case of the model ensures a comprehensive and relevant assessment. Key considerations for effective evaluation include:\n\n- **Clear objectives for LLM evaluation:** The evaluation objectives should align with the model\'s intended use case, whether it\'s for text generation, translation, summarization, or another task. These objectives should guide the selection of evaluation metrics and benchmarks to ensure they accurately measure the model\'s performance in the most relevant areas. This approach helps identify the model\'s strengths and weaknesses, guiding further improvements.\n- **Choosing relevant metrics and benchmarks:** The selected metrics should align with the evaluation objectives and provide a comprehensive view of the model\'s performance. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score can measure accuracy, while BLEU and ROUGE are useful for assessing text generation quality.   \n  Benchmarks should be chosen based on their ability to evaluate the model across various tasks relevant to its use case. The choice of metrics and benchmarks significantly influences the evaluation outcomes and the model’s subsequent fine-tuning.\n- **Balancing quantitative and qualitative analyses:** Quantitative analysis through automated metrics offers objective measures of a model\'s performance but may not capture all nuances across different tasks. Complementing this with qualitative human analysis helps assess aspects like coherence, relevance, and fluency in the model\'s output.   \n  This balance ensures a more holistic understanding of the model\'s capabilities and limitations, ensuring it not only performs well statistically but also generates high-quality, meaningful outputs.\n\n## Latest developments in LLM evaluation\n\nResearchers in the field of natural language generation (NLG) continue to work on evaluation frameworks for a more reliable and robust assessment of LLMs. Some of the recent developments include:\n\n### **Werewolf Arena**\n\nIntroduced by Google Research for evaluating LLMs, this framework leverages the classic game "Werewolf" to evaluate LLMs on their abilities in strategic reasoning, deception, and communication. This framework introduces dynamic turn-taking, where models bid for their chance to speak, simulating real-world conversational dynamics. By competing in an arena-style tournament, models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT series were tested, revealing significant differences in their strategic and communicative approaches. This innovative evaluation method offers a more interactive and challenging benchmark for assessing the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs.\n\n![Game loop of werewolf](https://images.prismic.io/turing/Zt57XRoQrfVKl1XD_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams-3-.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\n[Original image source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13943)\n\n### **G-Eval**\n\nAlso known as GPT-Eval, it’s a unique framework that focuses on using existing LLMs such as GPT-4 to assess the quality of texts generated by the NLG systems.\n\n![G-Eval framework](https://images.prismic.io/turing/ZwUWrYF3NbkBXAdN_LLM_Services_Organic_3_Diagrams-5-.jpg?auto=format,compress)\n\n[Original image source](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2303.16634)   \nThis evaluation method focuses on enhancing human alignment in assessing the quality of generated text outputs. By incorporating a chain-of-thought (CoT) approach and a form-filling paradigm, G-Eval aims to provide a more accurate and reliable evaluation of LLM outputs. Through experiments in tasks like text summarization and dialogue generation, G-Eval with GPT-4 demonstrates a significant Spearman correlation of 0.514 with human judgments in summarization tasks, surpassing previous evaluation methods by a considerable margin. Spearman\'s correlation coefficient ranges from -1 (strong negative correlation) to +1 (strong positive correlation).\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nEvaluating and benchmarking LLMs are essential for quantifying their reliability and effectiveness across various tasks.

From an engineering perspective, these LLM outputs can often be found in the form of [unit test cases](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-testing-in-2024-top-methods-and-strategies), while evaluation criteria can be packaged in the form of [LLM evaluation metrics](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation).\n\nOn the agenda, we have:\n\n- What is the difference between LLM and **LLM system evaluation**, and their benefits\n- **Offline evaluations**, what are LLM system benchmarks, how to construct evaluation datasets and choose the right LLM evaluation metrics (powered by [LLM-as-a-judge](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/why-llm-as-a-judge-is-the-best-llm-evaluation-method)), and common pitfalls\n- **Real-time evaluations**, and how they are useful in improving benchmark datasets for offline evaluations\n- Real-world **LLM system use cases and how to evaluate them**, featuring chatbotQA and Text-SQL\n\nLet’s begin.\n\n## LLM vs LLM System Evaluation\n\nLet’s get this straight: While an LLM (Large Language Model) refers specifically to the model (eg., GPT-4) trained to understand and generate human language, an LLM system refers to the complete setup that includes not only the LLM itself but also additional components such as function tool calling (for agents), retrieval systems (in RAG), response caching, etc., that makes LLMs useful for real-world applications, such as customer support chatbots, autonomous sales agents, and text-to-SQL generators.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that an LLM system can sometimes simply be composed of the LLM itself, as is the case with ChatGPT. Here is an example RAG-based LLM system that performs the Text-SQL task:\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d3ffe15bac0eeb479e8ce0_66795e89d080a7a81c5a5ffb_text-sql.png)\n\nA Hypothetical Text-SQL\xa0Architecture\n\nSince the primary goal of Text-SQL is to generate correct and efficient SQL for a given user query, the user query is usually first used to fetch the relevant tables in a database schema via a retrieval pipeline before using it as context to generate the correct SQL via a SQL generation pipeline. **Together, they make up a (RAG-based) LLM system.**\n\n*(Note: Technically, you don’t have to strictly perform a retrieval before generation, but even for a moderately sized database schema it is better to perform a retrieval to help the LLM hallucinate less.)*\n\nEvaluating an LLM system, is therefore not as straightforward as evaluating an LLM itself. While both LLMs and LLM systems receive and generate textual outputs, the fact that there can be several components working in conjunction in an LLM system means you **should** apply LLM evaluation metrics more granularly to evaluate different parts of an LLM system for maximum visibility into where things are going wrong (or right).\n\nFor example, you can apply a [contextual recall metric](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-contextual-recall) to evaluate the retrieval pipeline in the Text-SQL example above to assess whether it is able to retrieve all necessary tables needed to answer a particular user query.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66795638957002042d2032d5_1*cO7_-hbRVM9ovb59s73tkQ.png)\n\nContextual Recall metric can often be used to evaluate retrieval pipelines\n\nSimilarly, you can also apply a custom SQL correctness metric implemented via [G-Eval](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals) to evaluate whether the generation pipeline generates the correct SQL based on the top-K data tables retrieved.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/667956386168dd7d7075fe6a_1*fdwi5kegJ6af6XbVouD3KA.png)\n\nCustom SQL correctness metric can be used to evaluate SQL outputs\n\nIn summary, an LLM system is composed of multiple components that help make an LLM more effective in carrying out its task as shown in the Text-SQL example, and it is harder to evaluate because of its complex architecture.\n\nIn the next section, we will see how we can perform LLM system evaluation in development (aka. offline evaluations), including ways in which we can quickly create large amounts of test cases to unit test our LLM system, and how to pick the right LLM evaluation metrics for certain components.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Confident AI:\xa0The\xa0DeepEval LLM\xa0Evaluation Platform\n\nThe leading platform to evaluate and test LLM\xa0applications on the cloud, native to DeepEval.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nRegression test and evaluate LLM apps.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nEasily A|B test prompts and models.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nEdit and manage datasets on the cloud.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nLLM observability with online evals.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nPublicly sharable testing reports.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nAutomated human feedback collection.\n\n[Try Now for Free](https://app.confident-ai.com?utm_source=article)[Checkout DeepEval\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/661106881e9d2d02f5060281_maximize.png)](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/67d56572dc72582cf7e7f90a_confident-red.svg)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Got Red?

Imagine running evaluations in your local development environment which can be anything from a Python script, Colab/Jupyter Notebooks, to [CI/CD pipelines on Github Actions before deploying to production](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-testing-in-2024-top-methods-and-strategies). This allows you to quantitatively improve your LLM system architecture, or even iterate on the perfect set of **hyperparameters** for your LLM system (such as the LLM used, prompt templates, embedding model, etc. used in for each component).\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/667956384e81cbf62c4d904c_1*2XtyuGi93IssvUAbnFqLZA.png)\n\nLLM System Benchmark\n\nSome engineers also call this “**benchmarking**” an LLM system, which is not wrong at all. Benchmarking LLM systems refers to the process of quantifying LLM system performance on a set of custom criteria aided by [LLM evaluation metrics](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation#conclusion) on a **standardized evaluation dataset**, which is exactly how offline evaluations is carried out. Sticking to the Text-SQL example in the previous section, the metrics used to benchmark our LLM system would be the contextual recall and custom SQL correctness metric, and they would be used to quantify how well the Text-SQL LLM system is performing based on a set of user queries and SQL outputs, which we call test cases.\n\nTerminology wise, here’s what you need to know:\n\n- **Benchmarks** are made up of (usually one) **evaluation dataset** and LLM **evaluation metrics**.\n- An **evaluation dataset** is made up of **test cases**, which is what LLM evaluation metrics will be applied to.\n- There can be multiple LLM evaluation metrics for a single benchmark, each evaluating different parts of an LLM system for each test case.\n\nYou can then run these LLM system benchmarks in your local development environment each time you make changes to your LLM system (eg., switching to a different retrieval architecture, or LLM provider) to detect any breaking changes in performance, or even run these benchmarks in your [CI/CD pipeline to regression test your LLM system.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-testing-in-2024-top-methods-and-strategies)\n\nBefore moving on to the next section, here is a spoiler on how you can get everything setup in code using [⭐DeepEval⭐, the open-source LLM evaluation framework](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval):\n\n```\npip install deepeval\n\n```\n\n```\nfrom deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset\nfrom deepeval.metrics import ContextualRecallMetric\n\nmetric = ContextualRecallMetric(threshold=0.5)\n\ndataset = EvaluateionDataset(test_cases=[...])\ndataset.evaluate(metrics=[metric)\n\n```\n\nAnd for those who want to start evaluating immediately, checkout the [DeepEval quick-start guide.](https://deepeval.com/docs/getting-started)\n\n#### Evaluation Datasets and Test Cases\n\nAn evaluation dataset is a collection of test cases. An evaluation dataset is a collection of test cases. And no, I did not mistype the same sentence twice.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d3ffe15bac0eeb479e8ccd_66795efe87fbc21bdf298848_testcases.png)\n\nAn LLM\xa0Test Case\n\nA test case is simply a unit that holds the relevant data for you to unit test your LLM system on. Here are all the parameters an LLM test case contains:\n\n- **Input**\u200a—\u200athe input to your LLM system.\n- **Actual output**\u200a—\u200athe text response generated by your LLM system.\n- **Expected output**—\u200athe ideal response for a given input to your LLM system.\n- **Retrieval Context**\u200a—\u200athe text chunks / documents retrieved in a RAG pipeline / retrieval system.\n- **Context**\u200a—\u200athe ideal text chunks / documents that the expected output is derived from.\n\nHere’s the catch: different metrics requires different parameters to be populated in an LLM test case. For example, a reference-less answer relevancy metric (which you’ll learn later) will only require the input and actual output, while a reference-based answer relevancy metric will require the input, actual output, and expected output.\n\nAnother example can be found in the original contextual recall metric used earlier in the Text-SQL example. Since contextual recall assess whether your retrieval system is able to retrieve all the relevant text chunks to answer a certain query, you’ll need the input (ie. the query) and retrieval context (ie. the relevant text chunks that were retrieved).\n\nHere are some fast rules you’ll want to follow when preparing an evaluation dataset:\n\n- **Start with 50–100 test cases.** You can either curate these from scratch or take it from production data (if your LLM system is already in production). From experience, this number works best because it is enough to uncover weaknesses in your LLM system while not too overwhelming of a number to start with.\n- **Curate test cases that are most likely to fail** on whatever criteria you have decided to evaluate your LLM system on.\n- **Actual outputs does not have to be precomputed**, especially if you wish to [regression test your LLM system for every change you make.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-testing-in-2024-top-methods-and-strategies)\n- **Populate test cases with expected outputs.** As explain in the LLM metrics section, reference-based metrics give much more accurate results, which is why you’ll need expected outputs.\n\nAlthough I’ve stressed why it is important to prepare test cases with expected outputs, it is definitely not an easy task, especially for 50–100 test cases. Currently there are two main ways to curate evaluation datasets for your LLM system benchmark:\n\n- **Human annotation**\u200a—\u200athis one’s straightforward, hire someone to sit down and prepare 100 test cases. You can also curate test cases from production data if your LLM system is already live in production.\n- [**Synthetic data generation**](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-synthetic-data-generation-using-llms)\u200a—\u200aslightly more complicated, use LLMs to generate 100 test cases instead.\n\nI’d love to write a step-by-step guide on how to hire someone on Upwork, but for this article I’ll be touching on synthetic data generation using LLMs instead. [Synthetic data generation using LLMs](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-synthetic-data-generation-using-llms) involves supplying an LLM with **context**(yes, the same context in an LLM test case as outlined above), and generating a corresponding **input** and **expected output** based on the given context.\n\nFor example, in a Text-SQL use case, a great synthetic data generator would:\n\n1. Randomly (to add variety to your evaluation dataset) select different data tables in your database schema and use them as **context** to your test case.\n2. Generate a user query as **input** to your test case.\n3. Generate an **expected output** based on the context and input of your test case.\n4. Repeat until you have a reasonably sized evaluation dataset.\n\nHowever, you’ll also need to evolve your test case inputs to make them more realistic / indistinguishable from human annotated datasets. This is known as evolution, which is a technique used to make generated synthetic data more realistic, which was originally introduced in the [Evol-Instruct paper by Microsoft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244).\n\nIn fact, here is a great article on how to build your own synthetic data generator if you’re interested in how synthetic data generation works with LLMs, but if you want someone that is already production tested and open-source here is a quick way to generate synthetic data using LLMs via [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval):\n\n```\nfrom deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset\n\ndataset = EvaluationDataset()\ndataset.generate_goldens_from_docs(\n    document_paths=[\'example.pdf\'],\n    include_expected_output=True,\n    max_goldens_per_document=5\n)\n\n```\n\nNotice that in DeepEval we are generating “goldens”, which are basically **test cases but without actual outputs**. This means you’ll need to run your LLM system to generate actual outputs for each golden at evaluation time to make them viable LLM test cases.\n\n#### LLM Metrics\n\nLLM evaluation metrics are used to help automate the process of evaluating LLM systems. Sure, you can have human evaluators evaluate LLM systems for you, but at that point you will just be back to inefficiently vibe checking LLM outputs. **So the question is, how do I build my own LLM evaluation metric, or which LLM evaluation metrics should I used for my LLM system?**\n\n[In one of my previous articles, I talked in great detail on everything you need to know about LLM evaluation metrics](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation), but in summary, traditional metrics such as BERT, ROUGE, and n-gram doesn’t work because LLM outputs are too complex for statistical methods or non-LLM-models to evaluate, and so the solution is to resort to using LLMs-as-a-judge.\n\nLLM-as-a-judge involves using LLMs to score test cases. You may be skeptical at first, but [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634) has shown that using LLMs to evaluate LLMs is the closest we can get to human correlation.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/667958b48b5e014c61f0bbf7_1*BpkEg25L2V50RpbruX4Fyw.png)\n\nA higher Spearman and Kendall-Tau correlation represents higher alignment with human judgement.\n\nMoreover, techniques such as G-Eval, prompting to reduce the size of the text to be evaluated in a test case, or using QAG (Question Answer Generation) to more mathematically calculate a metric score for each test case, helps LLMs to produce scores that are much more aligned with human expectations. *(*[*I would highly recommend reading this article*](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation#g-eval) *if you are in any way confused or simply want to learn more about using LLMs to evaluate LLMs.)*\n\nHere is the list of the most commonly used LLM evaluation metrics for LLM systems, each evaluating different parts of an LLM system:\n\n- **Correctness**\n- **Answer Relevancy**\n- **Faithfulness**\n- **Similarity**\n- **Coherence**\n- **Contextual Recall**\n- **Contextual Relevancy**\n- **Contextual Precision**\n- **Bias**\n- **Toxicity**\n\n*(*[*DeepEval*](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) *supports each metric out-of-the-box, and you should* [*visit the docs*](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-introduction) *to learn more about each individual metric and when it should be used.)*\n\nFor example, here is how you can implement a custom LLM-as-a-judge “correctness” metric in code:\n\n```\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams\n\ncorrectness_metric = GEval(\n    name="Correctness",\n    criteria="Determine whether the actual output is factually correct based on information in the expected output.",\n    evaluation_params=[\n      LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, \n      LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT\n    ]\n)\n\n```\n\nWhen running evaluations in development, you should also aim to use **REFERENCE-BASED** metrics. Reference-based metrics are metrics that score based on some labelled, golden, ideal, expected output in a test case. Consider the answer relevancy metric for example, which can be both a reference-less and reference-based metric:\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d3ffe15bac0eeb479e8ce8_667960e7db0ba2352b961916_answer-relevancy.png)\n\nReference-less vs Reference-based Answer Relevancy\xa0Metric\n\nAlthough you can definitely compute the answer relevancy metric score by using an LLM to assess how relevant an LLM output is compared to the corresponding input, a better approach would be to have expected outputs and compare it to the generated LLM output instead. This is because reference-less metrics usually has a “looser” rubric, and so LLM computed metric scores are more likely to fluctuate more for the same set of test cases in a benchmark when compared to reference-based metrics. In other words, **reference-based metrics are more reliable.**\n\nSure, it takes more time and effort to curate evaluate datasets and populate each test case with expected outputs, but having supported hundreds of LLM evaluation use cases through DeepEval I can say with certainty that it definitely helps test LLM systems more accurately.\n\nThe good news is, in the next section I’ll show how you can semi-automate this process by generating synthetic datasets/test cases using an LLM.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Confident AI:\xa0The\xa0DeepEval LLM\xa0Evaluation Platform\n\nThe leading platform to evaluate and test LLM\xa0applications on the cloud, native to DeepEval.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nRegression test and evaluate LLM apps.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nEasily A|B test prompts and models.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nEdit and manage datasets on the cloud.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nLLM observability with online evals.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nPublicly sharable testing reports.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610ff7081317a42094c31f4_check%20(1).png)\n\nAutomated human feedback collection.\n\n[Try Now for Free](https://app.confident-ai.com?utm_source=article)[Checkout DeepEval\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/661106881e9d2d02f5060281_maximize.png)](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/67d56572dc72582cf7e7f90a_confident-red.svg)\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245a8a/6610f87e6d1d616ef38034d5_logoagain.svg)\n\n# Got Red?

This is because:\n\n- **There is no standard LLM evaluation metrics** for LLM systems (even for a given use case like Text-SQL), because the metrics depends on the exact architecture of an LLM system, and there is no standard architecture for any single use case.\n- **There is no standard set of test cases/evaluation dataset** for a given use case. For example, you will need two different evaluation datasets for two different database schemas for a Text-SQL use case since user queries and golden SQL outputs in test cases will be different.\n\n*(For those interested in learning more about pure LLM benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, and HellaSwag,* [*here is another great article.*](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-benchmarks-mmlu-hellaswag-and-beyond)*)*\n\nAnd before I forget, here is how you can benchmark your LLM system in code using the [answer relevancy metric](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-answer-relevancy):\n\n```\nfrom deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nfrom deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric\n\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\n  input="Why did the chicken cross the road?", \n  actual_output="Quite frankly, I don\'t want to know..."\n)\nmetric = AnswerRelevancyMetric()\n\ndataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[test_case])\ndataset.evaluate(metrics=[metric])\n\n```\n\n#### Common Pitfalls in Offline Evaluation\n\nThe biggest mistake one can make, is to assume your benchmark dataset is “good enough”, and to never improve on it over time. Improving your benchmark dataset is crucial because for your benchmark to make sense it should always reflect what the most recent vulnerabilities are in your LLM application.\n\nIn the next section, I’ll show how you can improve your benchmark evaluation dataset over time as you move your LLM system into production.\n\n## Real-time Evaluations\n\n*(If your LLM system is not in production, this section might be too early for you)*\n\nOffline evaluation is great for iterating, but it is limited by the comprehensiveness of your benchmark dataset. Although you can definitely have human annotators or data synthesizers curate more test cases based on data in your knowledge base, you’ll need to incorporate production data into your benchmark datasets to **simulate how a real living user would truly interact with your LLM application.**\n\nProduction data refers to the inputs and responses your LLM application receives and generates in a live production environment. But here’s a problem: you’ll most likely not have the time and resources to go through every single LLM response generated in production to determine which one of them should be added to your evaluation dataset.\n\nImagine a scenario where your LLM application generates 50k LLM responses in production a month. The chances are you won’t be able to go through all of them without losing your sanity. So you might resort to randomly sampling 10% of the generated responses, and manually go through them again, which is still an extremely taxing task. This is why real-time evaluations are valuable.\n\n**Real-time evaluations allow you to easily identify responses that are most likely to be unsatisfactory in production.** Instead of randomly sampling 10% of responses generated in production, a robust real-time evaluation infrastructure could allow you to filter for LLM responses that are failing on certain criteria. It helps human evaluators improve your LLM system benchmark using production data in a much more efficient way.\n\n#### LLM Metrics, in Production\n\nIn the previous LLM metrics section, we stressed that metrics in development should be reference-based metrics (ie. evaluates using the expected output on an LLM test case), because reference-based metrics helps benchmark scores to be more reliable due to a [stricter scoring rubric.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation)\n\nHowever, reference-baed metrics cannot be executed in production, simply because there are no expected outputs for each generated LLM response. So, we’ll be resorting to reference-less metrics instead. Below is an example of a reference-less answer relevancy metric (which we initially introduced as a reference-based metric in the previous LLM metric section):\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d3ffe15bac0eeb479e8cfc_6679614e7f9eed7bd6488236_answer-relevancy-again.png)\n\nReference-less Answer Relevancy Metric\n\nThe idea is to pick one or many reference-less metrics, use it to evaluate each incoming LLM response, and use these metric scores to figure out which LLM response should be added to augment your existing benchmark dataset.\n\nLastly, if you’re looking for an all-in-one solution to run real-time evaluations and manage benchmarks on the cloud, try [Confident AI](https://confident-ai.com/).

For each example, we’re going to follow the following steps:\n\n1. Generating synthetic test cases for your benchmark dataset\n2. Choose the relevant LLM evaluation metrics\n3. Run the benchmark\n\n#### Chatbot QA\n\nA chatbot QA (question-answering) is basically a chat based information search engine, but different from ChatGPT because it is not conversational. Most often used to quickly search for information in a knowledge base, it uses a RAG-based approach to first retrieve the relevant information by performing a vector search in the vector store that contains parsed and index information from your knowledge base, before feeding this information to your LLM to generate an answer for a given user query:\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d3ffe15bac0eeb479e8cff_6679606c1d8ff1f0ea48f82b_chatbot-qa.png)\n\nA hypothetical Chatbot QA architecture\n\n*(Note: this diagram and the Text-SQL one looks almost identical since both use cases are a simplified RAG-based LLM system)*\n\n**Step 1:** Assuming we already have a few PDF documents representing our knowledge-base titled knowledge\\_1.pdf, knowledge\\_2.pdf, etc., we can generate synthetic test cases from these documents for our chatbot QA application:\n\n```\nfrom deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer\n\nsynthesizer = Synthesizer()\ngoldens = synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_docs(\n    document_paths=[\n      \'knowledge_1.pdf\', \n      \'knowledge_1.pdf\',\n      \'knowledge_1.pdf\',\n      \'knowledge_1.pdf\',\n      \'knowledge_1.pdf\',\n      \'knowledge_1.pdf\'\n\n    ],\n    max_goldens_per_document=15,\n    include_expected_output=True\n)\n\n```\n\n[*(Link to synthesizer documentation here)*](https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-datasets-synthetic-data)\n\n**Step 2:** Now that we have some synthetic data generated, we can define our metrics. For this example, we’ll just be using two metrics: Correctness and Contextual Recall.\n\n```\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval, ContextualRecallMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams\n\ncontextual_recall = ContextualRecallMetric(threshold=0.6)\ncorrectness = GEval(\n    name="Correctness",\n    criteria="Determine whether the actual output is factually correct based on the expected output.",\n    evaluation_params=[\n      LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, \n      LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT\n    ],\n    threshold=0.6\n)\n\n```\n\n[*(Link to metrics documentation here)*](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-introduction)\n\nThe [G-Eval](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals) correctness metric compares the factual correctness of the actual output to the expected output, while [contextual recall](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-contextual-recall) assesses whether the retrieval context contains all the information needed to generate the expected output for the given input. Also note that we have set the passing threshold for each metric to 0.6, which means a test case will pass if and only if both metrics score higher or equal to 0.6.\n\n**PS. You should scroll up and revisit the chatbot QA diagram to see which part of the LLM system each metric evaluates.**\n\n**Step 3:** With our evaluation dataset and metrics ready, we can run our benchmark. We’re not going to implement a chatbot QA system, but lets assume we have a hypothetical function called `run_chatbot_qa()` that returns the generated response and the retrieved nodes used for response generation:\n\n```\nllm_output, retrieved_nodes = run_chatbot_qa("A user query")\n\n```\n\nWe can run the benchmark by first converting the goldens generated in step 1 to test cases that are ready for evaluation:\n\n```\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nfrom deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset\n...\n\ntest_cases = []\nfor golden in goldens:\n  query = golden.input\n  llm_output, retrieved_nodes = run_chatbot_qa(query)\n  test_case = LLMTestCase(\n    input=query,\n    actual_output=llm_output,\n    retrieval_context=retrieved_nodes,\n    expected_output=golden.expected_output   \n  )\n  test_cases.append(test_case)\n\ndataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=test_cases)\n\n```\n\n[*(Link to dataset documentation here)*](https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-datasets)\n\nLastly, run your benchmark by executing your dataset on the two metrics you defined:\n\n```\n...\n\ndataset.evaluate(metrics=[correctness, contextual_recall])\n\n```\n\nThat wasn’t so difficult after all, right?\n\n#### Text-SQL\n\nGoing full-circle, Text-SQL is a use case where an LLM system generates the relevant SQL query to answer a data analytical question. A data analytical question for example could be something like “How many users signed up last week”?\n\nWe’re going to reuse the same Text-SQL architecture diagram from the beginning of this article:\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64bd90bdba579d6cce245aec/66d3ffe15bac0eeb479e8d02_6679601d9c75daab9b4e74a1_text-sql-metric.png)\n\nA hypothetical Text-SQL architecture again\n\n**Step 1:** For this synthetic data generation step, we’re going to generate synthetic goldens using data tables in a database schema.\n\n```\nfrom deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer, UseCase\n\ntable1 = """CREATE TABLE Students (\n    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n    LastName VARCHAR(50),\n    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,\n    DateOfBirth DATE,\n    Gender CHAR(1),\n    Address VARCHAR(200),\n    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15)\n);"""\n\ntable2 = """CREATE TABLE Courses (\n    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    CourseName VARCHAR(100),\n    TeacherID INT,\n    Credits INT,\n    DepartmentID INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (TeacherID) REFERENCES Teachers(TeacherID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)\n);"""\n\ntable3 = """CREATE TABLE Enrollments (\n    EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    StudentID INT,\n    CourseID INT,\n    EnrollmentDate DATE,\n    Grade CHAR(2),\n    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)\n);"""\n\ntable4 = """CREATE TABLE Teachers (\n    TeacherID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n    LastName VARCHAR(50),\n    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,\n    DepartmentID INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)\n);"""\n\nsynthesizer = Synthesizer()\ngoldens = synthesizer.generate_goldens(\n    contexts=contexts,\n    use_case=UseCase.TEXT2SQL,\n    max_goldens_per_context=15\n)\n\n```\n\n[*(Link to synthesizer documentation here)*](https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-datasets-synthetic-data)\n\n**Step 2:** We’ll be using the custom SQL correctness metric and contextual recall metric:\n\n```\nfrom deepeval.metrics import ContextualRecallMetric\n\ncontextual_recall = ContextualRecallMetric(threshold=0.5)\nsql_correctness = GEval(\n    name="SQL Correctness",\n    evaluation_steps=[\n        "Check the `actual output` for SQL syntax errors.",\n        "Verify that the `actual output` SQL is compatible with the schema in the `retrieval context`, ensuring correct usage of tables and columns.",\n        "Execute the `actual output` SQL and ensure the results precisely match the `expected output`.",\n        "Confirm that the `actual output` SQL is indeed relevant to the `input` user query.",\n    ],\n    evaluation_params=[\n        LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT,\n        LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT,\n        LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT,\n        LLMTestCaseParams.RETRIEVAL_CONTEXT\n    ],\n)\n\n```\n\n[*(Link to metrics documentation here)*](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-introduction)\n\nSimilar to metrics used in chatbot QA, the SQL correctness and contextual recall metric assess the generator and retrieval pipeline respectively.\n\n**Step 3:** Let’s assume again we have another hypothetical function called `run_text_2_sql()` that returns the generated SQL query and the retrieved tabled used for SQL generation:\n\n```\nsql_output, retrieved_tables = run_text_2_sql("How many users signed up last week?")\n\n```\n\nWe can run the benchmark by first converting the goldens generated in step 1 to test cases that are ready for evaluation:\n\n```\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nfrom deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset\n...\n\ntest_cases = []\nfor golden in goldens:\n  query = golden.input\n  sql_output, retrieved_tables = run_text_2_sql(query)\n  test_case = LLMTestCase(\n    input=query,\n    actual_output=sql_output,\n    retrieval_context=retrieved_tables,\n    expected_output=golden.expected_output   \n  )\n  test_cases.append(test_case)\n\ndataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=test_cases)\n\n```\n\n[*(Link to dataset documentation here)*](https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-datasets)\n\nLastly, run your benchmark by executing your dataset on the two metrics you defined:\n\n```\n...\n\ndataset.evaluate(metrics=[sql_correctness, contextual_recall])\n\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations on making this far! In this long article, we’ve learnt the difference between LLMs and LLM systems, and how we can evaluate them differently.\n\nWe also learnt what offline evaluations are, including the concept of benchmarking using custom datasets and metrics to regression test LLM systems, and how [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) helps throughout the entire evaluation lifecycle.. We also saw how important it is to improve benchmark datasets over time, and how real-time evaluations in production can help. Lastly, we went through two prominent LLM application use cases, such as chatbot QA and Text-SQL, and how to evaluate them.\n\nDon’t forget to give [⭐ DeepEval a star on Github ⭐](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) if you found this article useful, and as always, till next time.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nDo you want to brainstorm how to evaluate your LLM (application)?

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ["Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, PaLM 2, LLaMA 2, and domain-adapted derivatives have ushered in a new era in natural language processing (NLP), marked by unprecedented advances in task generalization, generative capacity, and scalability. Comparative analysis of these models is crucial for understanding their empirical strengths and weaknesses, guiding model selection, practical deployment, and identifying ongoing research challenges. This section provides a comprehensive comparative assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs—integrating insights from benchmark-driven case studies, evaluations of core capabilities, practical deployment concerns (latency, speed, scalability), and effectiveness in user-centric scenarios.\n\nBenchmark-Based Comparative Case Studies\n\nEmpirical benchmarking has emerged as the gold standard for evaluating LLM performance across a wide spectrum of language tasks. Studies in 2024–2025 have deepened evaluation rigor by utilizing diverse and demanding benchmarks, such as MMLU, GLUE, SuperGLUE, HELM, and specialized biomedical NLP datasets. These benchmarks probe LLMs on tasks ranging from named entity recognition and information extraction to freeform question answering and long-form text generation.\n\nRecent case analyses have consistently demonstrated that closed-source models—most notably OpenAI’s GPT-4—achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in reasoning-intensive and generative tasks (e.g., medical question answering, complex reading comprehension) in zero-shot and few-shot configurations. For instance, on the MedQA benchmark within the biomedical domain, GPT-4 delivered zero-shot accuracies exceeding 71%, vastly outperforming both legacy fine-tuned models and open-source LLMs such as LLaMA 2. However, on extraction-heavy tasks like named entity recognition and relation extraction, traditional domain-specific models (e.g., fine-tuned BERT or BART variants) retain superiority in zero/few-shot regimes and especially when considerable labeled data is available.\n\nOpen-source models, especially LLaMA 2 and its derivatives, exhibit competitive performance—particularly after domain-specific fine-tuning—approaching or surpassing closed-source one-shot results on several benchmarks. Notably, domain-adapted LLMs (e.g., PMC LLaMA for biomedical tasks) do not necessarily confer marked advantages over generically pre-trained models, underscoring the need for improved domain adaptation strategies.\n\nBenchmarks also reveal critical pathologies inherent to LLM outputs: zero-shot and minimally conditioned generative outputs frequently suffer from inconsistency, missing information, and hallucinations, with error rates as high as 30% in certain biomedical settings (e.g., LLaMA 2, zero-shot). Incorporating even a single in-context example or employing modest fine-tuning can drastically reduce these errors, highlighting the practical value of tailored prompt engineering and continued pretraining.\n\nStrengths and Weaknesses Across Core Capabilities\n\nA nuanced comparative profile emerges when examining LLMs across axes of text generation, reasoning, factuality, multilinguality, and code understanding:\n\nText Understanding and Generation  \nTop-tier LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude excel in generating coherent, contextually appropriate, and nuanced text, surpassing both open-source models and legacy NLP systems on tasks involving complex reasoning and extended context retention. PaLM 2 demonstrates pronounced strengths in multilingual comprehension and code synthesis—the product of diverse and code-rich pretraining corpora.\n\nReasoning and Commonsense  \nInstruction-tuned, data-diverse LLMs show improved commonsense reasoning, yet adversarial logical puzzles or multi-step inference tasks continue to expose limitations, often necessitating structured prompt techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting).\n\nFactuality and Hallucination  \nFactual accuracy remains a primary vulnerability. All LLMs exhibit susceptibility to hallucinated outputs—statements that are fluently constructed yet factually erroneous. Leading models like GPT-4 have reduced, but not eliminated, hallucination frequency through reinforced alignment strategies, whereas open-source models demonstrate higher rates in zero-shot settings unless rigorously tuned.\n\nMultilingual and Code Capabilities  \nModels pre-trained on broad, multilingual and code-centric corpora (PaLM 2, LLaMA 2) dominate in cross-linguistic benchmarks and competitive programming tasks—with demonstrated ability in zero- and few-shot scenarios, particularly following domain-aware adaptation.\n\nComparisons with traditional, narrow-scope NLP models reaffirm that while LLMs are versatile and adaptable across domains, specialist models maintain higher efficiency, reliability, and interpretability for structured, data-rich tasks where explainability and resource constraints are paramount.\n\nPerformance Evaluation: Latency, Speed, and Scalability\n\nDeploying LLMs outside the laboratory entails rigorous assessment of operational parameters—inference latency, throughput speed, and resource scalability—each of which fundamentally constrains real-world use.\n\nLatency and Speed  \nA central trade-off exists between model size (and resultant accuracy) and inference latency/throughput. Larger models, like GPT-4, deliver top accuracy but incur greater response time and lower tokens-per-second output, especially on consumer or edge hardware. LLaMA 2, with smaller parameter counts, achieves significantly faster inference and higher throughput, which is advantageous for latency-sensitive applications such as conversational agents or real-time translation.\n\nScalability and Cost  \nModel scaling is computationally demanding: closed-source offerings such as GPT-4 can be up to 100 times more expensive per inference call than more modest models like GPT-3.5 or finely-tuned open-source LLaMA variants. Costs escalate non-linearly with increased parameterization, particularly for generative tasks requiring extensive input/output tokens. Cloud-based API solutions alleviate infrastructure demands at the expense of data privacy and operational expenditures.\n\nInference Optimizations  \nRecent research highlights latency-aware test-time scaling, parallelism (branch-wise, sequence-wise/speculative decoding), and model quantization as potent avenues for maximizing throughput and minimizing response lag. For example, parallel branch execution and speculative decoding have been shown to achieve substantial speedups with little accuracy loss, particularly on moderately sized hardware where memory bandwidth, not raw compute, is the limiting factor. Calibration of these optimization parameters to match hardware environments is now recognized as essential for robust, cost-effective deployment.\n\nEffectiveness: User Experience, Generalizability, and Robustness\n\nEvaluating an LLM's effectiveness necessitates consideration of its impact on user experience, adaptability to new domains, and resilience to adversarial or ambiguous input.\n\nUser Experience  \nSubjective aspects—such as helpfulness, informativeness, clarity, and conversational tone—correlate strongly with user satisfaction. LLMs refined through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) typically score higher in user studies, delivering responses better aligned with human expectations of safety and appropriateness.\n\nGeneralizability  \nState-of-the-art LLMs display impressive generalization—rapidly adapting to novel domains and tasks in few- or zero-shot settings. This transferability is especially valuable for enterprises deploying models in rapidly evolving or under-annotated domains, where retraining traditional models would be prohibitive.\n\nRobustness  \nWhile alignment and prompt engineering advances have enhanced LLMs’ resistance to simple adversarial attacks and noisy data, vulnerabilities persist—particularly in domain-specialized or safety-critical contexts. Comprehensive robustness assessments now routinely incorporate ambiguous queries and adversarial prompts to stress-test model reliability.\n\nCost vs. Performance and Evaluation Paradigms  \nThe nonlinear scaling of performance vs. inference cost underscores the need for context-sensitive model selection. Closed-source LLMs offer leadership on complex, reasoning-heavy tasks at a premium; open-source alternatives proffer modifiability and predictable costs, performing near parity after fine-tuning. Furthermore, traditional metrics (e.g., ROUGE, F1) often fail to capture nuanced generative performance or user-perceived quality, necessitating hybrid evaluation protocols that combine automated and manual analyses.\n\nGuidance and Emerging Best Practices in LLM Evaluation\n\nSelecting and deploying LLMs thus involves multidimensional trade-offs:\n\n- For complex, open-ended, or label-sparse settings, maximize value with advanced closed-source LLMs, leveraging parallel inference and hardware-aware optimization for latency management.\n- For resource-constrained or high-reliability scenarios, rely on fine-tuned open-source models or efficient traditional NLP architectures where interpretability and regulatory compliance are crucial.\n- Incorporate prompt engineering and minimal in-context learning to mitigate common LLM pathologies.\n- Prefer hybrid evaluation approaches combining automatic metrics with human review, especially for generative or user-facing applications.\n- Ongoing research directions include the development of new benchmarks that reflect LLM versatility (not just supervised extraction) and the systematic reduction of hallucination and inconsistency, especially in high-stakes domains.\n\nThis comparative analysis, rooted in current empirical evidence and real-world benchmarking, forms the essential foundation for both academic inquiry and informed decision-making in LLM-powered applications."], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='benchmark-based comparison case studies for large language models 2023'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2', title='Benchmarking large language models for biomedical ...', raw_content='Benchmarking large language models for biomedical natural language processing applications and recommendations | Nature Communications\n\n===============\n\nYour privacy, your choice\n-------------------------\n\nWe use essential cookies to make sure the site can function.

Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) automates the process. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general domains, their effectiveness in BioNLP tasks remains unclear due to limited benchmarks and practical guidelines. We perform a systematic evaluation of four LLMs—GPT and LLaMA representatives—on 12 BioNLP benchmarks across six applications. We compare their zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning performance with the traditional fine-tuning of BERT or BART models. We examine inconsistencies, missing information, hallucinations, and perform cost analysis. Here, we show that traditional fine-tuning outperforms zero- or few-shot LLMs in most tasks. However, closed-source LLMs like GPT-4 excel in reasoning-related tasks such as medical question answering. Open-source LLMs still require fine-tuning to close performance gaps. We find issues like missing information and hallucinations in LLM outputs. These results offer practical insights for applying LLMs in BioNLP.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![Image 2](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-024-01126-4/MediaObjects/41746_2024_1126_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [An in-depth evaluation of federated learning on biomedical natural language processing for information extraction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01126-4?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 15 May 2024\n\n![Image 3](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-024-01239-w/MediaObjects/41746_2024_1239_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [Closing the gap between open source and commercial large language models for medical evidence summarization](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01239-w?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 09 September 2024\n\n![Image 4](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-025-01533-1/MediaObjects/41746_2025_1533_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [Medical foundation large language models for comprehensive text analysis and beyond](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01533-1?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 05 March 2025\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nBiomedical literature presents direct obstacles to curation, interpretation, and knowledge discovery due to its vast volume and domain-specific challenges. PubMed alone sees an increase of approximately 5000 articles every day, totaling over 36 million as of March 2024[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR1 "Sayers, E. W. et al. Database resources of the National Center for Biotechnology Information in 2023. Nucleic Acids Res. 51, D29–D38 (2023)."). In specialized fields such as COVID-19, roughly 10,000 dedicated articles are added each month, bringing the total to over 0.4 million as of March 2024[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR2 "Chen, Q. et al. LitCovid in 2022: an information resource for the COVID-19 literature. Nucleic Acids Res. 51, D1512–D1518 (2023)."). In addition to volume, the biomedical domain also poses challenges with ambiguous language. For example, a single entity such as Long COVID can be referred to using 763 different terms[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR3 "Leaman, R. et al. Comprehensively identifying long COVID articles with human-in-the-loop machine learning. Patterns 4, 100659 (2023)."). Additionally, the same term can describe different entities, as seen with the term AP2, which can refer to a gene, a chemical, or a cell line[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR4 "Chen, Q. et al. BioConceptVec: creating and evaluating literature-based biomedical concept embeddings on a large scale. PLoS Comput. Biol. 16, e1007617 (2020)."). Beyond entities, identifying novel biomedical relations and capturing semantics in biomedical literature present further challenges[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR5 "Blake, C. Beyond genes, proteins, and abstracts: Identifying scientific claims from full-text biomedical articles. J. Biomed. Inform. 43, 173–189 (2010)."),[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR6 "Su, Y. et al. Deep learning joint models for extracting entities and relations in biomedical: a survey and comparison. Brief. Bioinforma. 23, bbac342 (2022).").\n\nTo overcome these challenges, biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) techniques are used to assist with manual curation, interpretation, and knowledge discovery. Biomedical language models are considered as the backbone of BioNLP methods; they leverage massive amounts of biomedical literature and capture biomedical semantic representations in an unsupervised or self-supervised manner. Early biomedical language models are non-contextual embeddings (e.g., word2vec and fastText) that use fully connected neural networks such as BioWordVec and BioSentVec[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR4 "Chen, Q. et al. BioConceptVec: creating and evaluating literature-based biomedical concept embeddings on a large scale. PLoS Comput. Biol. 16, e1007617 (2020)."),[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR7 "Zhang, Y., Chen, Q., Yang, Z., Lin, H., & Lu, Z. BioWordVec, improving biomedical word embeddings with subword information and MeSH. Sci. Data. 6, 1–9 (2019)."),[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR8 "Chen, Q., Peng, Y. & Lu, Z. BioSentVec: creating sentence embeddings for biomedical texts.In 2019 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI) 1–5 (IEEE, 2019)."). Since the inception of transformers, biomedical language models have adopted their architecture, and can be categorized into (1) encoder-based, masked language models using the encoder from the transformer architecture such as the biomedical bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) family including BioBERT and PubMedBERT[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR9 "Lee, J. et al. BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining. Bioinformatics 36, 1234–1240 (2020)."),[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR10 "Peng, Y., Yan, S., & Lu, Z. Transfer learning in biomedical natural language processing: an evaluation of BERT and ELMo on ten benchmarking datasets. In Proc. 18th BioNLP Workshop and Shared Task, 58–65 (Association for Computational Linguistics, Florence, Italy, 2019)."),[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR11 "Fang, L., Chen, Q., Wei, C.-H., Lu, Z. & Wang, K. Bioformer: an efficient transformer language model for biomedical text mining, arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.01588 (2023)."), (2) decoder-based, generative language models using the decoder from the transformer architecture such as the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) family including BioGPT and BioMedLM[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR12 "Luo, R. et al. BioGPT: generative pre-trained transformer for biomedical text generation and mining. Brief. Bioinforma. 23, bbac409 (2022)."),[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR13 "Venigalla, A., Frankle, J., & Carbin, M. Biomedlm: a domain-specific large language model for biomedical text, MosaicML. Accessed: Dec, 23 (2022)."), and (3) encoder-decoder-based, using both encoders and decoders such as BioBART and Scifive[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR14 "Yuan, H. et al. BioBART: Pretraining and evaluation of a biomedical generative language model. In Proc. 21st Workshop on Biomedical Language Processing, 97–109 (2022)."),[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR15 "Phan, L.N. et al. Scifive: a text-to-text transformer model for biomedical literature, arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.03598 (2021)."). BioNLP studies fine-tuned those language models and demonstrated that they achieved the SOTA performance in various BioNLP applications[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR10 "Peng, Y., Yan, S., & Lu, Z. Transfer learning in biomedical natural language processing: an evaluation of BERT and ELMo on ten benchmarking datasets.

Domain-specific language model pretraining for biomedical natural language processing. ACM Trans. Comput. Healthc. HEALTH, 3, 1–23 (2021)."), and those models have been successfully employed in PubMed-scale downstream applications such as biomedical sentence search[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR17 "Allot, A. et al. LitSense: making sense of biomedical literature at sentence level. Nucleic Acids Res. 47, W594–W599 (2019).") and COVID-19 literature mining[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR2 "Chen, Q. et al. LitCovid in 2022: an information resource for the COVID-19 literature. Nucleic Acids Res. 51, D1512–D1518 (2023).").\n\nRecently, the latest closed-source GPT models, including GPT-3 and, more notably, GPT-4, have made significant strides and garnered considerable attention from society. A key characteristic of these models is the exponential growth of their parameters. For instance, GPT-3 has ~175 billion parameters, which is hundreds larger than GPT-2. Models of this magnitude are commonly referred to as Large Language Models (LLMs)[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR18 "Zhao, W. X. et al. A survey of large language models, arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.18223 (2023)."). Moreover, the enhancement of LLMs is achieved through reinforcement learning with human feedback, thereby aligning text generation with human preferences[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR19 "Ouyang, L. et al. Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback. Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst. 35, 27730–27744 (2022)."). For instance, GPT-3.5 builds upon the foundation of GPT-3 using reinforcement learning techniques, resulting in significantly improved performance in natural language understanding[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR20 "Chen, X. et al. How Robust is GPT-3.5 to Predecessors? A Comprehensive Study on Language Understanding Tasks, arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.00293 (2023)."). The launch of ChatGPT—a chatbot using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4—has marked a milestone in generative artificial intelligence. It has demonstrated strong capabilities in the tasks that its predecessors fail to do; for instance, GPT-4 passed over 20 academic and professional exams, including the Uniform Bar Exam, SAT Evidence-Based Reading & Writing, and Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program[21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR21 "OpenAI, GPT-4 Technical Report, ArXiv, abs/2303.08774, (2023)."). The remarkable advancements have sparked extensive discussions among society, with excitement and concerns alike. In addition to closed-source LLMs, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR22 "Touvron, H. et al. Llama 2: Open foundation and fine-tuned chat models, arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.09288 (2023).") and Mixtral[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR23 "Jiang, A. Q. et al. Mixtral of experts arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.04088, 2024.") have been widely adopted in downstream applications and also used as the basis for continuous pretraining domain-specific resources. In the biomedical domain, PMC LLaMA (7B and 13B) is one of the first biomedical domain-specific LLMs that continuously pre-trained LLaMA on 4.8 M biomedical papers and 30 K medical textbooks[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR24 "Lee, P, Goldberg, C. & Kohane, I. The AI revolution in medicine: GPT-4 and beyond (Pearson, 2023)."). Meditron (7B and 70B), a more recent biomedical domain-specific LLM, employed a similar continuous pretraining strategy on LLaMA 2.\n\nPioneering studies have conducted early experiments on LLMs in the biomedical domain and reported encouraging results. For instance, Bubeck et al. studied the ability of GPT-4 in a wide spectrum, such as coding, mathematics, and interactions with humans. This early study reported biomedical-related results, indicating that GPT-4 achieved an accuracy of approximately 80% in the US Medical Licensing Exam (Step 1, 2, and 3), along with an example of using GPT-4 to verify claims in a medical note. Lee et al. also demonstrated use cases of GPT-4 for answering medical questions, generating summaries from patient reports, assisting clinical decision-making, and creating educational materials[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR24 "Lee, P, Goldberg, C. & Kohane, I. The AI revolution in medicine: GPT-4 and beyond (Pearson, 2023)."). Wong et al. conducted a study on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for end-to-end clinical trial matching, handling complex eligibility criteria, and extracting complex matching logic[25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR25 "Wong, C. et al. Scaling clinical trial matching using large language models: A case study in oncology. In Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference 846–862 (PMLR, 2023)."). Liu et al. explored the performance of GPT-4 on radiology domain-specific use cases[26](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR26 "Liu, Q. et al. Exploring the Boundaries of GPT-4 in Radiology. In Proc. of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing 14414–14445 (2023)."). Nori et al. further found that general-domain LLMs with advanced prompt engineering can achieve the highest accuracy in medical question answering without fine-tuning[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR27 "Nori, H. et al. Can generalist foundation models outcompete special-purpose tuning? Case study in medicine, arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.16452 (2023)."). Recent reviews also summarize related studies in detail[28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR28 "Tian, S. et al. Opportunities and challenges for ChatGPT and large language models in biomedicine and health. Brief. Bioinforma. 25, bbad493 (2024)."),[29](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR29 "He, K. et al. A survey of large language models for healthcare: from data, technology, and applications to accountability and ethics, arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.05694 (2023)."),[30](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR30 "Omiye, J.

Med. 177, 210–220 (2024).").\n\nThese results demonstrate the potential of using LLMs in BioNLP applications, particularly when minimal manually curated gold standard data is available and fine-tuning or retraining for every new task is not required. In the biomedical domain, a primary challenge is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which have a significantly lower scale than those in the general domain (e.g., a biomedical sentence similarity dataset only has 100 labeled instances in total[31](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR31 "Soğancıoğlu, G., Öztürk, H. & Özgür, A. BIOSSES: a semantic sentence similarity estimation system for the biomedical domain. Bioinformatics 33, i49–i58 (2017)."))[32](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR32 "Tinn, R. et al. Fine-tuning large neural language models for biomedical natural language processing. Patterns. 4, 100729 (2023)."),[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR33 "Chen, Q., Rankine, A., Peng, Y., Aghaarabi, E. & Lu, Z. Benchmarking effectiveness and efficiency of deep learning models for semantic textual similarity in the clinical domain: validation study. JMIR Med. Inform. 9, e27386 (2021)."). This challenges the fine-tuning approach because (1) models fine-tuned on limited labeled datasets may not be generalizable, and (2) it becomes more challenging to fine-tune the models with a larger size.\n\nMotivated by the early experiments, it is important to systematically assess the effectiveness of LLMs in BioNLP tasks and comprehend their impact on BioNLP method development and downstream users. Table[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab1) provides a detailed comparison of representative studies in this context. While our primary focus is on the biomedical domain, specifically the evaluation of LLMs using biomedical literature, we have also included two representative studies in the clinical domain (evaluating LLMs using clinical records) for reference. There are several primary limitations. First, most evaluation studies primarily assessed GPT-3 or GPT-3.5, which may not provide a full spectrum of representative LLMs from different categories. For instance, few studies evaluated more advanced closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4, LLM representatives from the general domain such as LLaMA[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR22 "Touvron, H. et al. Llama 2: Open foundation and fine-tuned chat models, arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.09288 (2023)."), and biomedical domain-specific LLMs such as PMC-LLaMA[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR34 "Wu, C. et al. PMC-LLaMA: toward building open-source language models for medicine, J. Am. Med. Inform. Associat. ocae045 (2024)."). Second, the existing studies mostly assessed extraction tasks where the gold standard is fixed. Few of these studies evaluated generative tasks such as text summarization and text simplification where the gold standard is free-text. Arguably, existing transformer models have demonstrated satisfactory performance in extractive tasks, while generative tasks remain a challenge in terms of achieving similar levels of proficiency. Therefore, it is imperative to assess how effective LLMs are in the context of generative tasks in BioNLP, examining whether they can complement existing models. Third, most existing studies only reported quantitative assessments such as the F1-score, with limited emphasis on qualitative evaluations. However, conducting qualitative evaluations (e.g., assessing the quality of LLM-generated text and categorizing inconsistent or hallucinated responses) to understand of the errors and impacts of LLMs on downstream applications in the biomedical domain are arguably more critical than mere quantitative metrics. For instance, studies on LLMs found a relatively low correlation between human judgments and automatic measures, such as ROUGE-L, commonly applied to text summarization tasks in the clinical domain[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR35 "Fleming, S. L. et al. MedAlign: A clinician-generated dataset for instruction following with electronic medical records. In Proc. AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence Vol. 38 22021–22030 (2023)."). Finally, it is worth noting that several studies did not provide public access to their associated data or codes. For example, few studies have made the prompts or selected examples for few-shot learning available. This hinders reproducibility and also presents challenges in evaluating new LLMs using the same setting for a fair comparison.\n\n**Table 1 A comparison of key elements from representative studies assessing large language models (LLMs) in the biomedical and clinical domains as of March 2024**\n\n[Full size table](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2/tables/1)\n\nIn this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in BioNLP applications to examine their great potentials as well as their limitations and errors. Our study has three main contributions.\n\nFirst, we performed comprehensive evaluations on four representative LLMs: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (representatives from closed-source LLMs), LLaMA 2 (a representative from open-sourced LLMs), and PMC LLaMA (a representative from biomedical domain-specific LLMs). We evaluated them on 12 BioNLP datasets across six applications: (1) named entity recognition, which extracts biological entities of interest from free-text, (2) relation extraction, which identifies relations among entities, (3) multi-label document classification, which categorizes documents into broad categories, (4) question answering, which provides answers to medical questions, (5) text summarization, which produces a coherent summary of an input text, and (6) text simplification, which generates understandable content of an input text. The models were evaluated under four settings: zero-shot, static few-shot, dynamic K-nearest few-shot, and fine-tuning where applicable. We compared these models against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches that use fine-tuned, domain-specific BERT or BART models. Both BERT and BART models are well-established in BioNLP research.\n\nOur results suggest that SOTA fine-tuning approaches outperformed zero- and few-shot LLMs in most of the BioNLP tasks. These approaches achieved a macro-average approximately 15% higher than the best zero- and few-shot LLM performance across 12 benchmarks (0.65 vs. 0.51) and over 40% higher in information extraction tasks, such as relation extraction (0.79 vs. 0.33). However, closed-source LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 demonstrated better zero- and few-shot performance in reasoning-related tasks such as medical question answering, where they outperformed the SOTA fine-tuning approaches. In addition, they exhibited lower-than-SOTA but reasonable performance in generation-related tasks such as text summarization and simplification, showing competitive accuracy and readability, as well as showing potential in semantic understanding tasks such as document-level classification. Among the LLMs, GPT-4 showed the overall highest performance, especially due to its remarkable reasoning capability. However, it comes with a trade-off, being 60 to 100 times more expensive than GPT-3.5. In contrast, open-sourced LLMs such as LLaMA 2 did not demonstrate robust zero- and few-shot performance – they still require fine-tuning to bridge the performance gap for BioNLP applications.\n\nSecond, we conducted a thorough manual validation on collectively over hundreds of thousands of sample outputs from the LLMs. For extraction and classification tasks where the gold standard is fixed (e.g., relation extraction and multi-label document classification), we examined (1) missing output, when LLMs fail to provide the requested output, (2) inconsistent output, when LLMs produce different outputs for similar instances, and (3) hallucinated output, when LLMs fail to address the user input and may contain repetitions and misinformation in the output[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR36 "Zhang, Y. et al. Siren’s song in the AI ocean: a survey on hallucination in large language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.01219 (2023)."). For text summarization tasks, two healthcare professionals performed manual evaluations assessing Accuracy, Completeness, and Readability. The results revealed prevalent cases of missing, inconsistent, and hallucinated outputs, especially for LLaMA 2 under the zero-shot setting. For instance, it had over 102 hallucinated cases (32% of the total testing instances) and 69 inconsistent cases (22%) for a multi-label document classification dataset.\n\nFinally, we provided recommendations for downstream users on the best practice to use LLMs in BioNLP applications. We also noted two open problems. First, the current data and evaluation paradigms in BioNLP are tailored to supervised methods and may not be fair to LLMs. For instance, the results showed that automatic metrics for text summarization may not align with manual evaluations. Also, the datasets that specifically target tasks where LLMs excel, such as reasoning, are limited in the biomedical domain. Revisiting data and evaluation paradigms in BioNLP are key to maximizing the benefits of LLMs in BioNLP applications. Second, addressing errors, missing information, and inconsistencies is crucial to minimize the risks associated with LLMs in biomedical and clinical applications. We strongly encourage a community effort to find better solutions to mitigate these issues.\n\nWe believe that the findings of this study will be beneficial for BioNLP downstream users and will also contribute to further enhancing the performance of LLMs in BioNLP applications. The established benchmarks and baseline performance could serve as the basis for evaluating new LLMs in the biomedical domain. To ensure reproducibility and facilitate benchmarking, we have made the relevant data, models, and results publicly accessible through [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14025500](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14025500)[37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR37 "Chen, Q. et al. A systematic evaluation of large language models for biomedical natural language processing: benchmarks, baselines, and recommendations. \n                  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14025500\n                  \n                 (2024).").\n\nResults\n-------\n\n### Quantitative evaluations\n\nTable[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab2) illustrates the primary evaluation metric results and their macro-averages of the LLMs under zero/few-shot (static one- and five-shot) and fine-tuning settings over the 12 datasets. The results on specific datasets were consistent with those independently reported by other studies, such as an accuracy of 0.4462 and 0.7471 on MedQA for GPT-3.5 zero-shot and GPT-4 zero-shot, respectively (0.4988 and 0.7156 in our study, respectively)[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR38 "Nori, H., King, N., McKinney, S. M., Carignan, D. & Horvitz, E. Capabilities of gpt-4 on medical challenge problems. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.13375 (2023)."). Similarly, a micro-F1 of 0.6224 and 0.6720 on HoC and LitCovid for GPT-3.5 zero-shot was reported, respectively (0.6605 and 0.6707 in our study, respectively)[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR39 "Labrak, Y., Rouvier, M. & Dufour, R. A zero-shot and few-shot study of instruction-finetuned large language models applied to clinical and biomedical tasks. In Proc. 2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-COLING 2024) 2049–2066 (ELRA and ICCL, 2024)."). An accuracy of 0.7790 on PubMedQA was also reported for the fine-tuned PMC LLaMA 13B (combined multiple question answering datasets for fine-tuning)[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR34 "Wu, C. et al. PMC-LLaMA: toward building open-source language models for medicine, J. Am. Med. Inform. Associat. ocae045 (2024)."); our study also reported a similar accuracy of 0.7680 using the PubMedQA training set only. We further summarized detailed results in Supplementary Information[S2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#MOESM1) Quantitative evaluation results, including secondary metric results in S2.2, performance mean, variance, and confidence intervals in S2.3, statistical test results in S2.4, and dynamic K-nearest few-shot results in S2.5.\n\n**Table 2 Quantitative evaluations of the LLMs on the 12 benchmarks under zero/few-shot (including static one- and five-shot)) and fine-tuned settings**\n\n[Full size table](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2/tables/2)\n\nSOTA vs. LLMs. The results of SOTA fine-tuning approaches for comparison are provided in Table[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab2). Recall that the SOTA approaches utilized fine-tuned (domain-specific) language models. For the extractive and classification tasks, the SOTA approaches fine-tuned biomedical domain-specific BERT models such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. For text summarization and simplification tasks, the SOTA approaches fine-tuned BART models.\n\nAs demonstrated in Table[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab2), the SOTA fine-tuning approaches had a macro-average of 0.6536 across the 12 datasets, whereas the best LLM counterparts were 0.4561, 0.4750, 0.4862, and 0.5131 under zero-shot, one-shot, five-shot, and fine-tuning settings, respectively. It outperformed the zero- and few-shot of LLMs in 10 out of the 12 datasets. It had much higher performance especially in information extraction tasks. For instance, for NCBI Disease, the SOTA approach achieved an entity-level F1-score of 0.9090, whereas the best results of LLMs (GPT-4) under zero- and one-shot settings were 30% lower (0.5988). The performance of LLMs is closer under the fine-tuning setting, with LLaMA 2 13B achieving an entity-level F1-score of 0.8682, but it is still lower. Notably, the SOTA fine-tuning approaches are very strong baselines – they were much more sophisticated than simple fine-tuning over a foundation model. Continuing with the example of NCBI Disease, the SOTA fine-tuning approach generated large-scale weak labeled examples and used contrastive learning to learn a general representation.\n\nIn contrast, the LLMs outperformed the SOTA fine-tuning approaches in question answering. For MedQA, the SOTA approach had an accuracy of 0.4195. GPT-4 under the zero-shot setting had almost 30% higher accuracy in absolute difference (0.7156), and GPT-3.5 also had approximately 8% higher accuracy (0.4988) under the zero-shot setting. For PubMedQA, the SOTA approach had an accuracy of 0.7340. GPT-4 under the one-shot setting had a similar accuracy (0.7100) and showed higher accuracy with more shots (0.7580 under the five-shot setting), as we will show later. Both LLaMA 2 13B and PMC LLaMA 13B also had higher accuracy under the fine-tuning setting (0.8040 and 0.7680, respectively). In this case, GPT-3.5 did not achieve higher accuracy over the SOTA approach, but it already had a competitive accuracy (0.6950) under the five-shot setting.\n\nComparisons among the LLMs. Comparing among the LLMs, under zero/few-shot settings, the results demonstrate that GPT-4 consistently had the highest performance. Under the zero-shot setting, the macro-average of GPT-4 was 0.4561, which is approximately 7% higher than GPT-3.5 (0.3814) and almost double than LLaMA 2 13B (0.2362). It achieved the highest performance in nine out of the 12 datasets, and its performance was also within 3% of the best result for the remaining three datasets. The one-shot and five-shot settings showed very similar patterns.\n\nIn addition, LLaMA2 13B exhibited substantially lower performance than GPT-3.5 (15% lower and 10% lower) and GPT-4 (22% lower and 17% lower) under zero- and one-shot settings. It had up to six times lower performance in specific datasets compared to the best LLM results; for example, 0.1286 vs. 0.7109 for HoC under the zero-shot setting. These results suggest that LLaMA2 13B still requires fine-tuning to achieve similar performance and bridge the performance gap. Fine-tuning improved LLaMA 2 13B’s macro-average from 0.2837 to 0.5131. Notably, its performance under the fine-tuning setting is slightly higher than the zero- and few-shot performance of GPT-4. Fine-tuning LLaMA 2 13B generally improved its performance in all tasks except text summarization and text simplification. A key reason for its performance limitation is that the datasets have much longer input context than its allowed input tokens (4096) such that fine-tuning did not help in this case. This observation also motivates further research efforts on extending LLMs’ context window[40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR40 "Jin, H. et al. Llm maybe longlm: Self-extend llm context window without tuning. In Proc. of Machine Learning Research, 235 22099–22114 (2024)."),[41](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR41 "Ding, Y. et al. LongRoPE: Extending LLM Context Window Beyond 2 Million Tokens, arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.13753 (2024).").\n\nUnder the fine-tuning setting, the results also indicate that PMC LLaMA 13B, as a continuously pretrained biomedical domain-specific LLM, did not achieve an overall higher performance than LLaMA 2 13B. Fine-tuned LLaMA 2 13B had better performance than that of PMC LLaMA 13B in 10 out of the 12 datasets. As mentioned, we reproduced similar results reported in PMC LLaMA study[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR34 "Wu, C. et al. PMC-LLaMA: toward building open-source language models for medicine, J. Am. Med. Inform. Associat. ocae045 (2024)."). For instance, it reported an accuracy of 0.7790 on PubMedQA with fine-tuning multiple question answering datasets together. We got a very similar accuracy of 0.7680 when fine-tuning PMC LLaMA 13B on the PubMedQA dataset only. However, we also found that directly fine-tuning of LLaMA 2 13B using the exact same setting resulted in better or at least similar performance.\n\n#### Few-shot and cost analysis\n\nFigure[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig1) further illustrates the performance of the dynamic K-nearest few-shot and the associated cost with the increasing number of shots. The detailed results are also provided in Supplementary Information[S2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#MOESM1). Dynamic K-nearest few-shot was conducted for K values of one, two, and five. For comparison, we also provided the zero-shot and static one-shot performance in the figure. The results suggest that dynamic K-nearest few-shot is most effective for multi-label document classification and question answering. For instance, for the LitCovid dataset, GPT-4 had a macro-F1 of 0.5901 under the static one-shot setting; in contrast, its macro-F1 under dynamic one-nearest shot was 0.6500 and further increased to 0.7055 with five-nearest shots. Similarly, GPT-3.5 exhibited improvements, with its macro-F1 under the static one-shot setting at 0.6009, compared to 0.6364 and 0.6484 for dynamic one-shot and five-shot, respectively. For question answering, the improvement was not as high as for multi-label document classification, but the overall trend showed a steady increase, especially considering that GPT-4 already had similar or higher performance than SOTA approaches with zero-shot. For instance, its accuracy on PubMedQA was 0.71 with a static one-shot; the accuracy increased to 0.72 and 0.75 under dynamic one-shot and five-shot, respectively.\n\n**Fig. 1: Dynamic K-nearest few-shot results (_K_ = 1, 2, and 5) shown in line charts, with associated costs (dollars per 100 instances) depicted in bar charts for each benchmark.**\n\n[![Image 5: figure 1](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-56989-2/MediaObjects/41467_2025_56989_Fig1_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2/figures/1)\n\nThe input and output types for each benchmark are displayed at the bottom of each subplot. Detailed methods for the few-shot and cost analysis are summarized in the Data and Methods section. Dynamic K-nearest few-shot involves selecting the K closest training instances as examples for each testing instance. Additionally, the performance of static one-shot (using the same one-shot example for each testing instance) is shown as a dashed horizontal line for comparison. Detailed performance in digits is also provided in Supplementary Information[S2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#MOESM1).\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2/figures/1)\n\nIn contrast, the results show that dynamic K-nearest few-shot was less effective for other tasks. For instance, the dynamic one-shot performance is lower than the static one-shot performance for both GPT models on the two named entity recognition datasets, and by increasing the number of dynamic shots does not help either. Similar findings are also observed in relation extraction. For text summarization and text simplification tasks, the dynamic K-nearest few-shot performance was slightly higher in two datasets, but in general, it was very similar to the static one-shot performance. In addition, the results also suggest that increasing the number of shots does not necessarily improve the performance. For instance, GPT-4 with dynamic five-shot did not have the highest performance in eight out of the 12 datasets. Similar findings were reported in other studies, where the performance of GPT-3.5 with five-shot learning was lower than that of zero-shot learning for natural language inference tasks[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR39 "Labrak, Y., Rouvier, M. & Dufour, R. A zero-shot and few-shot study of instruction-finetuned large language models applied to clinical and biomedical tasks. In Proc. 2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-COLING 2024) 2049–2066 (ELRA and ICCL, 2024).").\n\nFigure[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig1) further compares the costs per 100 instances of using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The cost is calculated based on the number of input and output tokens with unit price. We used gpt-4-0613 for extractive tasks and gpt-4-32k-0613 for generative tasks because the input and output context are much longer especially with more shots. GPT-4 generally exhibited the highest performance, as shown in both Table[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab2) and Fig.[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig1); however, the cost analysis results also demonstrate a clear trade-off, with GPT-4 being 60 to 100 times more expensive. For extractive and classification tasks, the actual cost per 100 instances of GPT-4 for five-shots ranges from approximately $2 for sentence-level inputs to around $10 for abstract-level inputs. This cost is 60 to 70 times higher than that of GPT-3.5, which costs approximately $0.03 for sentence-level inputs and around $0.16 for abstract-level inputs with five-shots. For generative tasks, the cost difference is even more pronounced, scaling to 100 times or more expensive. One reason is that GPT-4 32 K has a higher unit price, and tasks like text summarization involve much longer input and output tokens. Taking the PubMed Text Summarization dataset as an example, GPT-4 cost $84.02 per 100 instances with five-shots, amounting to approximately $5600 to inference the entire testing set. In comparison, GPT-3 only cost $0.71 per 100 instances for five-shots, totaling around $48 for the entire testing set.\n\nBased on both performance and cost results, it indicates that the cost difference does not necessarily scale to the performance difference, except for question answering tasks. GPT-4 exhibited 20% to 30% higher accuracy than GPT-3.5 in question-answering tasks, and higher than the SOTA approaches; for other tasks, the performance difference is much smaller with a significantly higher cost. For instance, the performance of GPT-4 on both text simplification tasks was within 2% of that of GPT-3.5, but the actual cost was more than 100 times higher.\n\n### Qualitative evaluations\n\n#### Error analysis on named entity recognition\n\nFigure[2A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig2) further shows an error analysis on the named entity recognition benchmark NCBI Disease, where the performance of LLMs under zero- and few-shot settings was substantially lower than SOTA results (e.g., the LLaMA 2 13B zero-shot performance is almost 70% lower). Recall that named entity recognition extracts entities from free text, and the benchmarks evaluate the accuracy of these extracted entities. We examined all the predictions on full test sets and categorized into four types: (1) correct entities, where the predicted entities are correct with both text spans and entity types, (2) wrong entities, where the predicted entities are incorrect, (3) missing entities, where the true entities are not predicted, and (4) boundary issues, where the predicted entities are correct but with different text spans than the gold standard, as shown in Fig.[2A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig2). The results reveal that the LLMs can predict up to 512 entities correctly out of 960 in total, explaining the low F1-score. As the SOTA model is not publicly available, we used an alternate fine-tuned BioBERT model on NCBI Disease from an independent study ([https://huggingface.co/ugaray96/biobert_ncbi_disease_ner](https://huggingface.co/ugaray96/biobert_ncbi_disease_ner)), which had an entity-level F1-score of 0.8920 for comparison. It predicted 863 entities out of 960 correctly. The wrong entities, missing entities, and boundary issues were 111, 97, and 269, respectively.\n\n**Fig. 2: Qualitative evaluation results on inconsistency, missing information, and hallucinations.**\n\n[![Image 6: figure 2](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-56989-2/MediaObjects/41467_2025_56989_Fig2_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2/figures/2)\n\n**A** Error analysis on the named entity recognition benchmark NCBI Disease. Correct entities: the predicted entities are correct with both text spans and entity types; Wrong entities: the predicted entities are incorrect; Missing entities: true entities are not predicted; and Boundary issues: the predicted entities are correct but with different text spans than the gold standard. **B**–**D** Qualitative evaluation on ChemProt, HoC, and MedQA where the gold standard is a fixed classification type or multiple-choice option. Inconsistent responses: the responses are in different formats; Missingness: the responses are missing; and Hallucinations, where LLMs fail to address the prompt and may contain repetitions and misinformation in the output.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2/figures/2)\n\nIn addition, Fig.[2A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig2) also shows that GPT-4 had the lowest number of wrong entities, whereas other categories have a similar prevalence to GPT-3.5, which explains its higher F1-score overall. Furthermore, providing one shot did not alter the errors for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 compared to their zero-shot settings, but it dramatically changed the results for LLaMA 2 13B. Under one-shot, LLaMA 2 13B had 449 correctly predicted entities, compared to 148 under zero-shot. Additionally, its missing entities also reduced from 812 to 511 with one-shot, but it also had a trade-off of more boundary issues and wrong entities.\n\n#### Evaluations on inconsistencies, missing information, and hallucinations\n\nFigure[2B–D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig2) present the qualitative evaluation results on ChemProt, HoC, and MedQA, respectively. Recall that we categorized inconsistencies, missing information, and hallucinations on the tasks where the gold standard is a fixed classification type or a multiple-choice option. Table[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab3) also provides detailed examples. The findings show prevalent inconsistent, missing, or hallucinated responses, particularly in LLaMA 2 13B zero-shot responses. For instance, it exhibited 506 hallucinated responses (~3% out of the total 16,943 instances) and 2376 inconsistent responses (14%) for ChemProt. In the case of HoC, there were 102 (32%) hallucinated responses and 69 (22%) inconsistent responses. Similarly, for MedQA, there were 402 (32%) inconsistent responses. In comparison, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 exhibited substantially fewer cases. GPT-3.5 showed a small number of inconsistent responses for ChemProt and HoC, and a few missing responses for MedQA. On the other hand, GPT-4 did not exhibit any such cases for ChemProt and HoC, while displaying a few missing responses for MedQA.\n\n**Table 3 Examples of inconsistent, missing, and hallucinated responses**\n\n[Full size table](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2/tables/3)\n\nIt is worth noting that inconsistent responses do not necessarily imply that they fail to address the prompts; rather, the responses answer the prompt but in different formats. In contrast, hallucinated cases do not address the prompts and may repeat the prompts or contain irrelevant information. All such instances pose challenges for automatic extraction or postprocessing and may require manual review. As a potential solution, we observed that adding just one shot could significantly reduce such cases, especially for LLaMA 2 13B, which exhibited prevalent instances in zero-shot. As illustrated in Fig.[2B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig2), LLaMA 2 13B one-shot dramatically reduced these cases in ChemProt and MedQA. Similarly, its hallucinated responses decreased from 102 to 0, and inconsistent cases decreased from 69 to 23 in HoC with one-shot. Another solution is fine-tuning, which we did not find any such cases during the manual examination, albeit with a trade-off of computational resources.\n\n#### Evaluations on accuracy, completeness, and readability\n\nFigure[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig3) presents the qualitative evaluation results on the PubMed Text Summarization dataset. In Fig.[3A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig3), the overall results in accuracy, completeness, and readability for the four models on 50 random samples are depicted. The evaluation results in digits are further demonstrated in Table[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab4) for complementary. Detailed results with statistical analysis and examples are available in Supplementary Information[S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#MOESM1). The fine-tuned BART model used in the SOTA approach[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR42 "Xie, Q., Huang, J., Saha, T. & Ananiadou, S. Gretel: Graph contrastive topic enhanced language model for long document extractive summarization.

In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 demonstrated similar and slightly higher accuracy (4.79 and 4.83, respectively) and statistically significantly higher readability than the fine-tuned BART model (4.66 and 4.73), but statistically significantly lower completeness (3.61 and 3.57) under the zero-shot setting. The LLaMA 2 13B zero-shot performance is substantially lower in all three aspects.\n\n**Fig. 3: Qualitative evaluation results on accuracy, completeness, and readability.**\n\n[![Image 7: figure 3](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-56989-2/MediaObjects/41467_2025_56989_Fig3_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2/figures/3)\n\n**A** The overall results of the fine-tuned BART, GPT-3.5 zero-shot, GPT-4 zero-shot, and LLaMA 2 zero-shot models on a scale of 1 to 5, based on random 50 testing instances from the PubMed Text Summarization dataset. **B** and **C** display the number of winning, tying, and losing cases when comparing GPT-4 zero-shot to GPT-3.5 zero-shot and GPT-4 zero-shot to the fine-tuned BART model, respectively.

In the comparison between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, GPT-4 had a slightly higher number of winning cases in the three aspects (4 winning cases vs. 1 losing case for accuracy, 17 vs. 13 for completeness, and 13 vs. 6 for readability). Most of the cases resulted in a tie. When comparing GPT-4 to the fine-tuned BART model, GPT-4 had significantly more winning cases for readability (34 vs. 1) with much fewer winning cases for completeness (9 vs. 22).\n\nDiscussions\n-----------\n\nFirst, the SOTA fine-tuning approaches outperformed zero- and few-shot performance of LLMs in most of BioNLP applications. As demonstrated in Table[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab2), it had the best performance in 10 out of the 12 benchmarks. In particular, it outperformed zero- and few-shot LLMs by a large margin in information extraction and classification tasks such as named entity recognition and relation extraction, which is consistent to the existing studies[43](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR43 "Jimenez Gutierrez, B. et al. Thinking about GPT-3 in-context learning for biomedical IE? Think again. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2022, 4497–4512 (Association for Computational Linguistics, 2022)."),[44](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR44 "Rehana, H. et al. Evaluation of GPT and BERT-based models on identifying protein-protein interactions in biomedical text, arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.17728 (2023)."). In contrast to, other tasks such as medical question answering, named entity recognition, and relation extraction require limited reasoning and extract information directly from inputs at the sentence-level. Zero- and few-shot learning may not be appropriate or sufficient for these conditions. For those tasks, arguably, fine-tuned biomedical domain-specific language models are still the first choice and have already set a high bar, according to the literature[32](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR32 "Tinn, R. et al. Fine-tuning large neural language models for biomedical natural language processing. Patterns. 4, 100729 (2023).").\n\nIn addition, closed-source LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 demonstrated reasonable zero- and few-shot capabilities for three BioNLP tasks. The most promising task that outperformed the SOTA fine-tuning approaches is medical question answering, which involves reasoning[45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR45 "Jin, Q. et al. Biomedical question answering: a survey of approaches and challenges. ACM Comput. Surv. (CSUR) 55, 1–36 (2022)."). As shown in Table[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab2) and Fig.[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig1), GPT-4 already outperformed previous fine-tuned SOTA approaches in MedQA and PubMedQA with zero- or few-shot learning. This is also supported by the existing studies on medical question answering[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR38 "Nori, H., King, N., McKinney, S. M., Carignan, D. & Horvitz, E. Capabilities of gpt-4 on medical challenge problems. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.13375 (2023)."),[46](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR46 "Singhal, K. et al. Large language models encode clinical knowledge, Nature 620, 1–9 (2023)."). The second potential use case is text summarization and simplification. As shown in Table[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab2), those tasks are still less favored by the automatic evaluation measures; however, manual evaluation results show both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 had higher readability and competitive accuracy compared to the SOTA fine-tuning approaches. Other studies reported similar findings regarding the low correlation between automatic and manual evaluations[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR35 "Fleming, S. L. et al. MedAlign: A clinician-generated dataset for instruction following with electronic medical records. In Proc. AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence Vol. 38 22021–22030 (2023)."),[47](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR47 "Chang, Y. et al. A survey on evaluation of large language models, ACM Trans. Intell. Syst. Technol. (2023)."). The third possible use case – though still underperformed by previous fine-tuned SOTA approaches – document-level classification, which involves semantic understanding. As shown in Fig.[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig1), GPT-4 achieved over a 0.7 F1-score with dynamic K-nearest shot for both multi-label document-level classification benchmarks.\n\nIn addition to closed-source LLMs, open-source LLMs such as LLaMA 2 do not demonstrate strong zero- and few-shot capabilities. While there are other open-source LLMs available, LLaMA 2 remains as a strong representative[48](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR48 "Minaee, S. et al. Large language models: A survey, arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.06196 (2024)."). Results in Table[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab1) suggest that its overall zero-shot performance is 15% and 22% lower than that of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively, and up to 60% lower in specific BioNLP tasks. Not only does it exhibit suboptimal performance, but the results in Fig.[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig2) also demonstrate that its zero-shot responses frequently contain inconsistencies, missing elements, and hallucinations, accounting for up to 30% of the full testing set instances. Therefore, fine-tuning open-source LLMs for BioNLP tasks is still necessary to bridge the gap. Only through fine-tuning LLaMA 2, its overall performance is slightly higher than the one-shot GPT-4 (4%). However, it is worth noting that the model sizes of LLaMA 2 and PMC LLaMA are significantly smaller than those of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, making it challenging to evaluate them on the same level. Additionally, open-source LLMs have the advantage of continued development and local deployment.\n\nAnother primary finding on open-source LLMs is that the results do not indicate significant performance improvement from continuously biomedical pre-trained LLMs (PMC LLaMA 13B vs. LLaMA 2 13B). As mentioned, our study reproduced similar results reported in PMC LLaMA 13B; however, we also found that directly fine-tuning LLaMA 2 yielded better or at least similar performance—and this is consistent across all 12 benchmarks. In the biomedical domain, representative foundation LLMs such as PMC LLaMA used 32 A100 GPUs[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR34 "Wu, C. et al. PMC-LLaMA: toward building open-source language models for medicine, J. Am. Med. Inform. Associat. ocae045 (2024)."), and Meditron used 128 A100 GPUs to continuously pretrain from LLaMA or LLaMA 2[49](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR49 "Chen, Z. et al. Meditron-70b: Scaling medical pretraining for large language models, arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.16079 (2023)."). Our evaluation did not find significant performance improvement for PMC LLaMA; the Meditron study also only reported ~3% improvement itself and only evaluated on question answering datasets. At a minimum, the results suggest the need for a more effective and sustainable approach to developing biomedical domain-specific LLMs.\n\nThe automatic metrics for text summarization and simplification tasks may not align with manual evaluations. As the quantitative results on text summarization and generation demonstrated, commonly used automatic evaluations such as Rouge, BERT, and BART scores consistently favored the fine-tuned BART’s generated text, while manual evaluations show different results, indicating that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 had competitive accuracy and much higher readability even under the zero-shot setting. Existing studies also reported that the automatic measures on LLM-generated text may not correlate to human preference[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR35 "Fleming, S. L. et al. MedAlign: A clinician-generated dataset for instruction following with electronic medical records. In Proc. AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence Vol. 38 22021–22030 (2023)."),[47](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR47 "Chang, Y. et al. A survey on evaluation of large language models, ACM Trans. Intell. Syst. Technol. (2023)."). The MS^2 benchmark used in the study also discussed the limitation of automatic measures, specifically for text summarization[50](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR50 "DeYoung, J., Beltagy, I., van Zuylen, M., Kuehl, B. & Wang, L. L. Ms2: Multi-document summarization of medical studies. In Proc. 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 7494–7513 (2021)."). Additionally, the results highlight that completeness is a primary limitation when adapting GPT models to biomedical text generation tasks despite its competitive accuracy and readability scores.\n\nLast, our evaluation on both performance and cost demonstrates a clear trade-off when using LLMs in practice. GPT-4 had the overall best performance in the 12 benchmarks, with an 8% improvement over GPT-3.5 but also at a higher cost (60 to 100 times higher than GPT-3.5). Notably, GPT-4 showed significantly higher performance, particularly in question-answering tasks that involve reasoning, such as over 20% improvement in MedQA compared to GPT-3.5. This observation is consistent with findings from other studies[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR27 "Nori, H. et al. Can generalist foundation models outcompete special-purpose tuning? Case study in medicine, arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.16452 (2023)."),[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR38 "Nori, H., King, N., McKinney, S. M., Carignan, D. & Horvitz, E. Capabilities of gpt-4 on medical challenge problems. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.13375 (2023)."). Note that newer versions of GPT-4, such as GPT-4 Turbo, may further reduce the cost of using GPT-4.\n\nThese findings lead to recommendations for downstream users to apply LLMs in BioNLP applications, summarized in Fig.[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Fig4). It provides suggestions on which BioNLP applications are recommended (or not) for LLMs, categorized by conditions (e.g., the zero/few-shot setting when computational resources are limited) and additional tips (e.g., when advanced prompt engineering is more effective).\n\n**Fig. 4: Recommendations for using LLMs in BioNLP applications.**\n\n[![Image 8: figure 4](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-56989-2/MediaObjects/41467_2025_56989_Fig4_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2/figures/4)\n\nIt presents specific task-based recommendations across different settings and offers general guidance on effectively applying LLMs in BioNLP.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2/figures/4)\n\nWe also recognize the following two open problems and encourage a community effort for better usage of LLMs in BioNLP applications.\n\nAdapting both data and evaluation paradigms is essential to maximize the benefits of LLMs in BioNLP applications. Arguably, the current datasets and evaluation settings in BioNLP are tailored to supervised (fine-tuning) methods and is not fair for LLMs. Those issues challenge the direct comparison between the fine-tuned biomedical domain-specific language models and zero/few shot of LLMs. The datasets for the tasks where LLMs excel are also limited in the biomedical domain. Further, the manual measures on biomedical text summarization also showed different results than that of all three automatic measures. These collectively suggest the current BioNLP evaluation frameworks have limitations when they are applied to LLMs[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR35 "Fleming, S. L. et al. MedAlign: A clinician-generated dataset for instruction following with electronic medical records. In Proc. AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence Vol. 38 22021–22030 (2023)."),[51](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR51 "Wornow, M. et al. The shaky foundations of large language models and foundation models for electronic health records. npj Digit. Med. 6, 135 (2023)."). They may not be able to accurately assess the full benefits of LLMs in biomedical applications, calling for the development of new evaluation datasets and methods for LLMs in bioNLP tasks.\n\nAddressing inconsistencies, missingness, and hallucinations produced by LLMs is critical. The prevalence of inconsistencies, missingness, and hallucinations generated by LLMs is of concern, and we argue that they must be addressed for deployment. Our results demonstrate that providing just one shot could significantly reduce the occurrence of such issues, offering a simple solution. However, thorough examination in real-world scenario validations is still necessary. Additionally, more advanced approaches for validating LLMs’ responses are expected for further improvement of their reliability and usability[47](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR47 "Chang, Y. et al. A survey on evaluation of large language models, ACM Trans. Intell. Syst. Technol. (2023).").\n\nThis study also has several limitations that should be acknowledged. While this study examined strong LLM representatives from each category (closed-source, open-source, and biomedical domain-specific), it is important to note that there are other LLMs, such as BARD[52](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR52 "Manyika, J. An overview of Bard: an early experiment with generative AI. \n                  https://ai.google/static/documents/google-about-bard.pdf\n                  \n                 (2023).") and Mistral[53](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR53 "Jiang, A. Q. et al. Mistral 7B, arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.06825, (2023)."), that have demonstrated strong performance in the literature. Additionally, while we investigated zero-shot, one-shot, dynamic K-nearest few-shot, and fine-tuning techniques, each of them has variations, and there are also new approaches[54](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR54 "Neelakantan, A. et al. Text and code embeddings by contrastive pre-training, arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.10005 (2022)."). Given the rapidly growing nature of this area, our study cannot cover all of them. Instead, our aim is to establish baseline performance on the main BioNLP applications using commonly used LLMs and methods as representatives, and to make the datasets, methods, codes, and results publicly available. This enables downstream users to understand when and how to apply LLMs in their own use cases and to compare new LLMs and associated methods on the same benchmarks. In the future, we also plan to assess LLMs in real-world scenarios in the biomedical domain to further broaden the scope of the study.\n\nMethods\n-------\n\n### Evaluation tasks, datasets, and metrics\n\nTable[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab5) presents a summary of the evaluation tasks, datasets, and metrics. We benchmarked the models on the full testing sets of the twelve datasets from six BioNLP applications, which are BC5CDR-chemical and NCBI-disease for Named Entity Recognition, ChemProt and DDI2013 for relation extraction, HoC and LitCovid for multi-label document classification, and MedQA and PubMedQA for question answering, PubMed Text Summarization and MS^2 for text summarization, and Cochrane PLS and PLOS Text Simplification for text simplification. These datasets have been widely used in benchmarking biomedical text mining challenges[55](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR55 "Krallinger, M. et al.

We evaluated the datasets using the official evaluation metrics provided by the original dataset description papers, as well as commonly used metrics for method development or applications with the datasets, as documented in Table[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab5). Note that it is challenging to have a single one-size-fits-all metric, and some datasets and related studies used multiple evaluation metrics. Therefore, we also adopted secondary metrics for additional evaluations. A detailed description is below.\n\n**Table 5 Evaluation datasets, dataset size, and evaluation metrics**\n\n[Full size table](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2/tables/5)\n\nNamed entity recognition.

The biomedical entities can be described in various ways, and resolving the ambiguities is crucial[58](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR58 "International Society for Biocuration, Biocuration: Distilling data into knowledge, Plos Biol., 16, e2002846 (2018)."). Named entity recognition is typically a sequence labeling task, where each token is classified into a specific entity type. BC5CDR-chemical[59](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR59 "Li, J. et al. BioCreative V CDR task corpus: a resource for chemical disease relation extraction, Database, 2016 (2016).") and NCBI-disease[60](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR60 "Doğan, R. I., Leaman, R. & Lu, Z. NCBI disease corpus: a resource for disease name recognition and concept normalization. J. Biomed. Inform. 47, 1–10 (2014).") are manually annotated named entity recognition datasets for chemicals and diseases mentioned in biomedical literature, respectively. The exact match (that is, the predicted tokens must have the same text spans as the gold standard) F1-score was used to quantify the model performance.\n\nRelation extraction. Relation extraction involves identifying the relationships between entities, which is important for drug repurposing and knowledge discovery[61](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR61 "Li, X., Rousseau, J. F., Ding, Y., Song, M. & Lu, W. Understanding drug repurposing from the perspective of biomedical entities and their evolution: Bibliographic research using aspirin. JMIR Med. Inform. 8, e16739 (2020)."). Relation extraction is typically a multi-class classification problem, where a sentence or passage is given with identified entities and the goal is to classify the relation type between them. ChemProt[55](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR55 "Krallinger, M. et al. Overview of the BioCreative VI chemical-protein interaction Track. In Proc. of the sixth BioCreative challenge evaluation workshop Vol. 1, 141–146 (2017).") and DDI2013[62](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR62 "Segura-Bedmar, I., Martínez, P. & Herrero-Zazo, M. Semeval-2013 task 9: extraction of drug-drug interactions from biomedical texts (ddiextraction 2013). In Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (* SEM), Volume 2: Proc. Seventh International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2013) 341–350 (Association for Computational Linguistics, 2013).") are manually curated relation extraction datasets for protein-protein interactions and drug-drug interactions from biomedical literature, respectively. Macro and micro F1-scores were used to quantify the model performance.\n\nMulti-label document classification. Multi-label document classification identifies semantic categories at the document-level. The semantic categories are effective for grasping the main topics and searching for relevant literature in the biomedical domain[63](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR63 "Du, J. et al. ML-Net: multi-label classification of biomedical texts with deep neural networks. J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 26, 1279–1285 (2019)."). Unlike multi-class classification, which assigns only one label to an instance, multi-label classification can assign up to N labels to an instance. HoC[64](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR64 "Baker, S. et al. Automatic semantic classification of scientific literature according to the hallmarks of cancer. Bioinformatics 32, 432–440 (2016).") and LitCovid[56](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR56 "Chen, Q. et al. Multi-label classification for biomedical literature: an overview of the BioCreative VII LitCovid Track for COVID-19 literature topic annotations, Database 2022, baac069 (2022).") are manually annotated multi-label document classification datasets for hallmarks of cancer (10 labels) and COVID-19 topics (7 labels), respectively. Macro and Micro F1 scores were used as the primary and secondary evaluation metrics, respectively.\n\nQuestion answering. Question answering evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of a system in answering a given biomedical question with or without associated contexts[45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR45 "Jin, Q. et al. Biomedical question answering: a survey of approaches and challenges. ACM Comput. Surv. (CSUR) 55, 1–36 (2022)."). Biomedical QA datasets such as MedQA and PubMedQA have been widely used in the evaluation of language models[65](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR65 "Kaddari, Z., Mellah, Y., Berrich, J., Bouchentouf, T. & Belkasmi, M. G. Biomedical question answering: A survey of methods and datasets. In 2020 Fourth International Conference On Intelligent Computing in Data Sciences (ICDS) 1–8 (IEEE, 2020)."). The MedQA dataset is collected from questions in the United States Medical License Examination (USMLE), where each instance contains a question (usually a patient description) and five answer choices (e.g., five potential diagnoses)[66](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR66 "Jin, D. et al. What disease does this patient have? A large-scale open domain question answering dataset from medical exams. Appl. Sci. 11, 6421 (2021)."). The PubMedQA dataset includes biomedical research questions from PubMed, and the task is to use yes, no, or maybe to answer these questions with the corresponding abstracts[67](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR67 "Jin, Q., Dhingra, B., Liu, Z., Cohen, W. & Lu, X. Pubmedqa: A dataset for biomedical research question answering. In Proc. 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, 2567–2577 (EMNLP-IJCNLP, 2019)."). Accuracy and macro F1-score are used as the primary and secondary evaluation metrics, respectively.\n\nText summarization. Text summarization produces a concise and coherent summary of a longer documents or multiple documents while preserving its essential content. We used two primary biomedical text summarization datasets: the PubMed text summarization benchmark[68](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR68 "Cohan, A. et al. A discourse-aware attention model for abstractive summarization of long documents. In Proc. 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Languag Technologies Vol. 2, 615–621 (2018).") and MS^2[50](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR50 "DeYoung, J., Beltagy, I., van Zuylen, M., Kuehl, B. & Wang, L. L. Ms2: Multi-document summarization of medical studies. In Proc. 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 7494–7513 (2021)."). The PubMed text summarization benchmark focuses on single document summarization where the input is a full PubMed article, and the gold standard output is its abstract. M2^2 in contrast, focuses on multi-document summarization where the input is a collection of PubMed articles, and the gold standard output is the abstract of a systematic review study that cites those articles. Both benchmarks used the ROUGE-L score as the primary evaluation metric; BERT score and BART score were used as secondary evaluation metrics.\n\nText simplification. Text simplification rephrases complex texts into simpler language while maintaining the original meaning, making the information more accessible to a broader audience. We used two primary biomedical text simplification datasets: Cochrane PLS[69](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR69 "Devaraj, A., Wallace, B. C., Marshall, I. J. & Li, J. J. Paragraph-level simplification of medical texts. In Proc. 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies 4972–4984 (Association for Computational Linguistics, 2021).") and the PLOS text simplification benchmark[70](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR70 "Luo, Z., Xie, Q., & Ananiadou, S. Readability controllable biomedical document summarization. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP, 4667–4680 (2022)."). Cochrane PLS consists of the medical documents from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the corresponding plain-language summary (PLS) written by the authors. The PLOS text simplification benchmark consists of articles from PLOS journals and the corresponding technical summary and PLS written by the authors. The ROUGE-L score was used as the primary evaluation metric. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) and Dale-Chall Readability Score (DCRS), two commonly used evaluation metrics on readability[71](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR71 "Goldsack, T. et al. Overview of the biolaysumm 2024 shared task on lay summarization of biomedical research articles. In Proc. 23rd Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing 122–131 (2024).") were used as the secondary evaluation metrics.\n\n### Baselines\n\nFor each dataset, we reported the reported SOTA fine-tuning result before the rise of LLMs as the baseline. The SOTA approaches involved fine-tuning (domain-specific) language models such as PubMedBERT[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR16 "Gu, Y. et al. Domain-specific language model pretraining for biomedical natural language processing. ACM Trans. Comput. Healthc. HEALTH, 3, 1–23 (2021)."), BioBERT[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR9 "Lee, J. et al. BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining. Bioinformatics 36, 1234–1240 (2020)."), or BART[72](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR72 "Lewis, M. et al. Bart: Denoising sequence-to-sequence pre-training for natural language generation, translation, and comprehension. In Proc. 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7871–7880 (2020).") as the backbone. The fine-tuning still requires scalable manually labeled instances, which is challenging in the biomedical domain[32](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR32 "Tinn, R. et al. Fine-tuning large neural language models for biomedical natural language processing. Patterns. 4, 100729 (2023)."). In contrast, LLMs may have the advantage when minimal manually labeled instances are available, and they do not require fine-tuning or retraining for every new task through zero/few-shot learning. Therefore, we used the existing SOTA results achieved by the fine-tuning approaches to quantify the benefits and challenges of LLMs in BioNLP applications.\n\n### Large language models\n\nRepresentative LLMs and their versions. Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have been regularly updated. For reproducibility, we used the snapshots gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 and gpt-4-0613 for extractive tasks, and gpt-4-32k-0613 for generative tasks, considering their input and output token sizes. Regarding LLaMA 2, it is available in 7B, 13B, and 70B versions. We evaluated LLaMA 2 13B based on the computational resources required for fine-tuning, which is arguably the most common scenario applicable to BioNLP downstream applications. For PMC LLaMA, both 7B and 13B versions are available. Similarly, we used PMC LLaMA 13B, specifically evaluating it under the fine-tuning setting – the same setting used in its original study[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR34 "Wu, C. et al. PMC-LLaMA: toward building open-source language models for medicine, J. Am. Med. Inform. Associat. ocae045 (2024)."). In the original study, PMC LLaMA was only evaluated on medical question answering tasks, combining multiple question answering datasets for fine-tuning. In our case, we fine-tuned each dataset separately and reported the results individually.\n\nPrompts. To date, prompt design remains an open research problem[73](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR73 "Liu, P. et al. Pre-train, prompt, and predict: A systematic survey of prompting methods in natural language processing. ACM Comput. Surv. 55, 1–35 (2023)."),[74](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR74 "Hu, Y. et al. Improving large language models for clinical named entity recognition via prompt engineering, J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 31, ocad259 (2024)."),[75](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR75 "Wang, L. et al. Investigating the impact of prompt engineering on the performance of large language models for standardizing obstetric diagnosis text: comparative study. JMIR Format Res. 8, e53216 (2024)."). We developed a prompt template that can be used across different tasks based on existing literature[74](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR74 "Hu, Y. et al. Improving large language models for clinical named entity recognition via prompt engineering, J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 31, ocad259 (2024)."),[75](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR75 "Wang, L. et al. Investigating the impact of prompt engineering on the performance of large language models for standardizing obstetric diagnosis text: comparative study. JMIR Format Res. 8, e53216 (2024)."),[76](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR76 "Agrawal, M., Hegselmann, S., Lang, H., Kim, Y. & Sontag, D. Large language models are few-shot clinical information extractors. In Proc. 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 1998–2022 (2022)."),[77](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR77 "Keloth, V. K. et al. Advancing entity recognition in biomedicine via instruction tuning of large language models. Bioinformatics 40, btae163 (2024)."). An annotated prompt example is provided in Supplementary Information[S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#MOESM1) Prompt engineering, and we have made all the prompts publicly available in the repository. The prompt template contains (1) task descriptions (e.g., classifying relations), (2) input specifications (e.g., a sentence with labeled entities), (3) output specifications (e.g., the relation type), (4) task guidance (e.g., detailed descriptions or documentations on relation types), and (5) example demonstrations if examples from training sets are provided. This approach aligns with previous studies in the biomedical domain, which have demonstrated that incorporating task guidance into the prompt leads to improved performance[74](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR74 "Hu, Y. et al. Improving large language models for clinical named entity recognition via prompt engineering, J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 31, ocad259 (2024)."),[76](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR76 "Agrawal, M., Hegselmann, S., Lang, H., Kim, Y. & Sontag, D. Large language models are few-shot clinical information extractors. In Proc. 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 1998–2022 (2022).") and was also employed and evaluated in our previous study, specifically focusing on named entity recognition[77](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR77 "Keloth, V. K. et al. Advancing entity recognition in biomedicine via instruction tuning of large language models. Bioinformatics 40, btae163 (2024)."). We also adapted the SOTA example selection approach in the biomedical domain described below[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR27 "Nori, H. et al. Can generalist foundation models outcompete special-purpose tuning? Case study in medicine, arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.16452 (2023).").\n\nZero-shot and static few-shot. We comparatively evaluated the zero-shot, one-shot, and five-shot learning performances. Only a few studies have made the selected examples available. For reproducibility and benchmarking, we first randomly selected the required number of examples in training sets, used the same selected examples for few-shot learning, and made the selected examples publicly available.\n\nDynamic K-nearest few-shot. In addition to zero- or static few-shot learning where fixed instructions are used for each instance, we further evaluated the LLMs under a dynamic few-shot learning setting. The dynamic few-shot learning is based on the MedPrompt approach, the SOTA method that demonstrated robust performance in medical question answering tasks without fine-tuning[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR27 "Nori, H. et al. Can generalist foundation models outcompete special-purpose tuning? Case study in medicine, arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.16452 (2023)."). The essence is to use K training instances that are most similar to the test instance as the selected examples. We denote this setting as dynamic K-nearest few-shot, as the prompts for different test instances differ. Specifically, for each dataset, we used the SOTA text embedding model text-embedding-ada-002[54](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR54 "Neelakantan, A. et al. Text and code embeddings by contrastive pre-training, arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.10005 (2022).") to encode the instances and used cosine similarity as the metric for finding similar training instances to a testing instance. We tested dynamic K-nearest few-shot prompts with K equals to one, two, and five.\n\nParameters for prompt engineering. For zero-, one-, and few-shot approaches, we used a temperature parameter of 0 to minimize variance for both GPT and LLaMA-based models. Additionally, for LLaMA models, we maintained other parameters unchanged, set the maximum number of generated tokens per task, and truncated the instances due to the input length limit for the five-shot setting. Further details are provided in Supplementary Information[S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#MOESM1) Prompt engineering, and the related codes are available in the repository.\n\nFine-tuning. We further conducted instruction fine-tuning on LLaMA 2 13B and PMC-LLaMA 13B. For each dataset, we fine-tuned LLaMA 2 13B and PMC- LLaMA 13B using its training set. The goal of instruction fine-tuning is defined by the objective function: \\({\\arg }{\\max }_{\\theta }{\\sum}_{\\left({x}^{i},{y}^{i}\\right)\\epsilon (X,Y)}{logp}({y}^{i}|{x}^{i};\\theta )\\), where \\({x}^{i}\\) represents the input instruction, \\({y}^{i}\\) is the ground truth response, and \\(\\theta\\) is the parameter set of the model. This function aims to maximize the likelihood of accurately predicting responses based on the given instructions. The fine-tuning is performed on eight H100 80G GPUs, over three epochs with a learning rate of 1e−5, a weight decay of 1e−5, a warmup ratio of 0.01, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-effective tuning[78](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR78 "Hu, E. J. et al. Lora: Low-rank adaptation of large language models, arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.09685 (2021).").\n\nOutput parsing. For extractive and classification tasks, we extracted the targeted predictions (e.g., classification types or multiple-choice options) from the raw outputs of LLMs with a combination of manual and automatic processing. We manually reviewed the processed outputs. Manual review showed that LLMs provided answers in inconsistent formats in some cases. For example, when presenting multiple-choice option C, the raw output examples included variations such as: “Based on the information provided, the most likely … is C. The thyroid gland is a common site for metastasis, and …”, “Great! Let’s go through the options. A. … B. …Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C.”, and “I’m happy to help! Based on the patient’s symptoms and examination findings, … Therefore, option A is incorrect. …, so option D is incorrect. The correct answer is option C.” (adapted from real responses with unnecessary details omitted). In such cases, automatic processing might overlook the answer, potentially lowering LLM accuracy. Thus, we manually extracted outputs in these instances to ensure fair credit. Additionally, we qualitatively evaluated the prevalence of such cases (providing responses in inconsistent formats), which will be introduced below.\n\n### Evaluations\n\nQuantitative evaluations. We summarized the evaluation metrics in Table[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#Tab5) under zero-shot, static few-shot, dynamic K-nearest few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. The metrics are applicable to the entire testing sets of 12 datasets. We further conducted bootstrapping using a subsample size of 30 and repeated 100 times at a 95% confidence interval to report performance variance and performed a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test using SciPy[79](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR79 "Virtanen, P. et al. SciPy 1.0: fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python. Nat. Methods 17, 261–272 (2020)."). Further details are provided in Supplementary Information[S2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#MOESM1) Quantitative evaluation results (S2.1. Result reporting).\n\nQualitative evaluations on inconsistency, missing information, and hallucinations. For the tasks where the gold standard is fixed, e.g., a classification type or multiple-choice option, we conducted qualitative evaluations on collectively hundreds of thousands of raw outputs of the LLMs (the raw outputs from three LLMs under zero- and one-shot conditions across three benchmarks) to categorize errors beyond inaccurate predictions. Specifically, we examined (1) inconsistent responses, where the responses are in different formats, (2) missingness, where the responses are missing, and (3) hallucinations, where LLMs fail to address the prompt and may contain repetitions and misinformation in the output[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR36 "Zhang, Y. et al. Siren’s song in the AI ocean: a survey on hallucination in large language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.01219 (2023)."). We evaluated and reported the results in selected datasets: ChemProt, HoC, and MedQA.\n\nQualitative evaluations on accuracy, completeness, and readability. For the tasks with free-text gold standards, such as summaries, we conducted qualitative evaluations on the quality of generated text. Specifically, one senior resident and one junior resident evaluated four models: the fine-tuned BART model reported in the SOTA approach, GPT-3.5 zero-shot, GPT-4 zero-shot, and LLaMA 2 13B zero-shot on 50 random samples from the PubMed Text Summarization benchmark. Each annotator was provided with 600 annotations. To mitigate potential bias, the model outputs were all lowercased, their orders were randomly shuffled, and the annotators were unaware of the models being evaluated. They assessed three dimensions on a scale of 1—5: (1) accuracy, does the generated text contain correct information from the original input, (2) completeness, does the generated text capture the key information from the original input, and (3) readability, is the generated text easy to read. The detailed evaluation guideline is provided in Supplementary Information[S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#MOESM1) Qualitative evaluation on the PubMed Text Summarization Benchmark.\n\n#### Cost analysis\n\nWe further conducted a cost analysis to quantify the trade-off between cost and accuracy when using GPT models. The cost of GPT models is determined by the number of input and output tokens. We tracked the tokens in the input prompts and output completions using the official model tokenizers provided by OpenAI ([https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken)) and used the pricing table ([https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)) to compute the overall cost.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the[Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#MOESM2) linked to this article.\n\nData availability\n-----------------\n\nAll data supporting the findings of this study, including source data, are available in the article and Supplementary Information, and can be accessed publicly via [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14025500](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14025500)[37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56989-2#ref-CR37 "Chen, Q. et al.

To perform software testing, testers need to write code snip-pets that execute the program under test. Re-cently, researchers have recognized the poten-tial of large language models (LLMs) in soft-ware testing. However, there remains a lack of fair comparisons between different LLMs in terms of test case generation capabilities.\nIn this paper, we propose TESTEVAL, a novel benchmark for test case generation with LLMs.\nWe collect 210 Python programs from an on-line programming platform, LeetCode, and de-sign three different tasks: overall coverage, targeted line/branch coverage, and targeted path coverage. We further evaluate 17 pop-ular LLMs, including both commercial and open-source ones, on TESTEVAL.\nWe find that generating test cases to cover specific pro-gram lines/branches/paths is still challenging for current LLMs, indicating a lack of abil-ity to comprehend program logic and execu-tion paths. We have open-sourced our dataset and benchmark pipelines at https://github.\ncom/LLM4SoftwareTesting/TestEval.\n1 Introduction Software testing is a crucial aspect of software de-velopment, allowing developers to identify poten-tial bugs and check if the program behavior meets expectations. A key task in software testing is test case generation, which involves creating test inputs to cover different statements and branches in the program under test. Previous research indicates that test case generation can be extremely time-consuming, taking up over 15% of the time spent in software development (Daka and Fraser, 2014).\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nTherefore, automated test case generation has been a long-standing challenge in software engi-neering research. Various methods have been de-veloped to address this issue, including symbolic execution testing (Chipounov et al., 2011; Cadar et al., 2011), search-based testing (Fraser and Ar-curi, 2011; Baresi and Miraz, 2010; Fraser and Zeller, 2010), and deep learning-based approaches (Tufano et al., 2020). Recently, researchers have been exploring the potential of using LLMs to gen-erate unit test cases (Lemieux et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023). However, despite the rapid development of LLM-based test case gen-eration, there is still a lack of public benchmarks to evaluate different LLMs’ capabilities in this area.\nHence, there is a need for a comprehensive analysis to determine whether current LLMs can (1) gener-ate diverse test cases to achieve high coverage on a program under test, (2) generate test cases to cover a specific line or branch, and (3) generate test cases to cover a specific execution path by following the tester’s intent.\nTo bridge this gap, we present a new benchmark, TESTEVAL, which focuses on evaluating LLMs’ test case generation capabilities. The TESTEVAL dataset consists of 210 Python programs from the online coding platform LeetCode. We design three tasks to address the aforementioned challenges: (1) overall coverage, (2) targeted line/branch coverage, and (3) targeted path coverage.\nNotably, unlike popular code generation bench-marks (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021) or software testing datasets (Just et al., 2014; Lemieux et al., 2023), the tasks in our TESTEVAL bench-mark require LLMs to reason about intricate pro-gram execution behaviors. To generate inputs that invoke specific branches or paths in the program under test, the LLM must have a comprehensive understanding of how to satisfy certain branch conditions during execution.\nFurthermore, our tasks emphasize program logic analysis rather than 3547 Program Under Test NL Description Benchmark Tasks Overall Coverage Target Line/Branch Target Path LLMs Raw Tests Test Cases def test_isMatch(): isMatch([TEST_INPUT]) Evaluation Correctness Coverage Post-processing Figure 1: The pipeline for running and evaluating LLMs for test case generation on TESTEVAL.\nmerely simulating numerical operations, as seen in benchmarks designed for predicting a program’s input/output (Gu et al., 2024).\nWe perform extensive experiments on TESTE-VAL with both commercial and open-source LLMs.\nOur results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate executable and diverse test cases, they struggle to identify which specific state-ments or branches need to be covered. For exam-ple, in targeted line coverage, 12 out of 16 LLMs’ performances are not significantly improved (im-provements ≤5%) compared to the results when the target line information is even not given. Quan-titative results show that commercial LLMs, such as GPT-4, generally outperform open-source LLMs in both overall coverage and targeted line/branch/-path coverage. These findings suggest that future work on test case generation should focus on devel-oping advanced LLM-based reasoning frameworks to enhance the understanding of program behaviors during testing.\nOur work makes the following contributions: • Benchmark. We propose TESTEVAL, a bench-mark focused on evaluating LLMs’ capabilities in generating test cases for a given program under test, encompassing three different tasks.\n• Evaluation. We design new metrics to measure the LLM’s test generation performance and con-duct experiments with 17 popular LLMs.\n• Analysis. We perform a systematic analysis of LLMs’ performance on TESTEVAL and discuss the challenges and opportunities in test case gen-eration using LLMs.\n2 Approach In this section, we first introduce the tasks included in our benchmark (§ 2.1). Following that, we pro-vide an overview of the dataset used (§ 2.2).\n2.1 Task Description Figure 1 shows the workflow of TESTEVAL. We propose three distinct tasks in our benchmark: (1) overall coverage, (2) targeted line and branch cov-erage, and (3) targeted path coverage. For each task, we prompt an LLM to generate test cases for a specified program based on the task description in natural language. Specifically, in each query round, we prompt the LLM to generate a testing function containing a single test case (see Appendix A for the complete prompt templates). Then, we filter out any non-code content that may have been gen-erated outside the testing function, retaining only the first test case generated in each query round to ensure a fair comparison across different LLMs.\nAfter generation, all test cases must undergo a correctness check, which consists of syntactic correctness, execution correctness, and assertion correctness. Syntactic correctness determines if the generated test case is free of syntax errors, while execution correctness evaluates if the test case can be executed successfully without any runtime er-rors. Assertion correctness evaluates whether the generated test case contains correct test assertions.\nRegarding execution correctness, we do not con-sider incorrect test assertion statements to be failed cases, since test cases with assertion errors can still cover the program under test. Finally, we evaluate coverage metrics on test cases that pass the correct-ness check. We now illustrate our three benchmark tasks in detail.\nAlgorithm 1: Computing the average line/branch cov@k given a set of programs Input: A set of programs under test P = {p1, p2, ...}, k Output: The average cov@k for all programs: cov@kall cov@k = []; for pi in P do Generate N test cases Ti = {ti1, ti2, ..., tiN}; Retain M executable test cases Ti = {ti1, ti2, ..., tiM}; if Ti = ∅then cov@k.append(0); else Randomly split Ti into max(⌊M/k⌋, 1) groups, each group Tij with k test cases; covi = []; for Tij in \x08 Ti1, Ti2, ..., Ti⌊M/k⌋ do Compute line/branch coverage covTij ; covi.append(covTij ); end cov@k.append(avg(covi)) end end cov@kall ←avg(cov@k); return cov@kall Overall coverage. In this task, we query each LLM for N rounds given a program under test.\nDuring the ith (1 < i ≤N) round, we prompt the 3548 20 for i, c in enumerate(s): 21 if c == \'.\': 22 if seenDot or seenE: 23 return False 24 seenDot = True 25 elif c == \'e\' or c == \'E\': 26 if seenE or not seenNum: 27 return False 28 seenE = True 29 seenNum = False Target branches: […, [21-24], [22-23], [25-29], [26-27], …] Target lines: {…, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, …} Figure 2: An example for selecting targeted lines and branches from programs under test.\nLLM to generate a test method different from the j (1 ≤j < i)th rounds. After all rounds of query, we obtain N test cases for each program under test.\nThe overall coverage for a program is computed by the proportion of lines/branches in the program that have been covered by at least one test case.\nWe further propose a new metric, cov@k, to mea-sure the diversity of LLM’s generated test cases for a given program. Intuitively, cov@k measures the line/branch coverage with a subset of the generated test cases with a size of k (k < M). To achieve this, we randomly split M executable test cases into max(⌊M/k⌋, 1) subsets. Then for each of these subsets, we calculate its overall line/branch cover-age. In our experiments, we choose k as 1, 2, and 5. When k increases, the improvements of cov@k can measure the diversity of the LLM’s generated test cases. We summarize the calculation of the average line/branch cov@k for a set of programs under test in Algorithm 1.\nTargeted line and branch coverage. Different from overall coverage, targeted line and branch coverage requires the LLM to generate test cases that could cover a specific branch, or a line inside this branch. This simulates the scenario in which a human tester is asked to craft test cases to cover a specific part of the program. Figure 2 shows an example of targeted branches and lines in a given program. To measure the targeted line/path cov-erage, we prompt the LLMs by including the line number(s) in the instruction (see prompt templates in Appendix A). For each targeted line/branch, an LLM is prompted to generate one test case.\nTargeted path coverage. In real-world software development, testers sometimes need to craft test cases to cover a specific execution path that in-cludes multiple branches. We refer to this task as the target path coverage. We show an example program in Figure 3 to demonstrate the importance of the target path coverage.\nIn Line 6, a bug (divided by zero) will occur only if branches “condition 1” and “condition 2” are both not executed. In this case, only covering the two conditional branches is not sufficient. By contrast, if we can cover all three paths (Figure 3), we can successfully detect the “divided by zero” bug. To obtain the target path coverage, we prompt an LLM by including a specific execution path (see Appendix A for the prompt template). For each path, an LLM is queried to generate one test case.\nWe further propose two metrics to evaluate the performance of target path coverage. First, for a given target path, we measure whether the gener-ated test case covers the target path completely.\nSecond, we measure the similarity between the given target path PATHtgt and the execution path of the LLM’s generated test case PATHgen by Eq. 1: sim(PATHgen, PATHtgt) = lcs(PATHgen, PATHtgt) len(PATHtgt) (1) where lcs() calculates the length of the longest contiguous common sub-sequence between two paths and len() calculates the length of a path.\n2.2 Benchmark Dataset Data collection.\nTo construct our benchmark dataset, we first collect solution programs of Leet-Code, an online platform for evaluating a program-mer’s coding performance. We choose LeetCode as our data source since it has a clear task description and input constraint for each programming task.\nWe first select all publicly available tasks up to Apr.\n2024. Then, we collect its Python solution for each task from a GitHub repository 1. At this stage, we collect 3,123 programs under test.\nThe main goal of our benchmark is to evalu-ate LLMs’ capability to generate test cases that cover specific statements/branches. Therefore, we filter out programs that are too simple (e.g., pro-grams that only have one branch) according to the cyclomatic complexity (McCabe, 1976). Given the control flow graph of a program, the cyclo-matic complexity V of this program is measured by: V = e−n+p, where e is the number of edges in the graph, n is the number of nodes, and p is the number of connected components. The cyclomatic complexity is positively correlated with the number of branches/loops in a program. In this work, we consider programs with the cyclomatic complexity 1https://github.com/walkccc/LeetCode. The repository is under MIT license.\n3549 … 1 a = 0 2 if condition 1: 3 a += 1 4 elif condition 2: 5 a += 2 6 b = 1/a … Execution paths: … -> condition 1 -> … … -> not(condition 1) -> condition 2 -> … … -> not(condition 1) -> not(condition 2) -> … Execution paths: … -> Enter if branch at #2 -> … … -> Enter elif branch at #4 -> … … -> … condition 1 condition 2 b = 1/a a += 1 True False condition 1 condition 2 b = 1/a a += 1 a += 2 True False True condition 1 condition 2 b = 1/a a += 1 a += 2 True False True 1. … -> condition 1 -> … 2. … -> not(condition 1) -> condition 2 -> … 3. … -> not(condition 1) -> not(condition 2) -> … Figure 3: A motivating example showing the importance of path coverage (left), and examples of execution paths extracted from this program (right).\n≥10. This filters down the sample size from 3,123 to 216. We further check these 216 problems and remove similar problems with identical solutions.\nFinally, we collect 210 Python programs for our benchmark, consisting of 9 easy problems, 100 medium problems, and 101 hard problems accord-ing to LeetCode’s difficulty label. Each program under test is also paired with its task description in natural language. Note that most programs al-ready have test cases in their task descriptions. We remove these cases to prevent LLMs from directly copying these test cases.\nFor each program, we perform the following pre-processing steps: • We add all necessary import statements for the packages required by the Python solution.\n• Python programmers often split long state-ments into multiple physical lines. For all statements split into multiple lines, we rewrite them in a single line. This ensures each state-ment only corresponds to one line when mea-suring line coverage.\n• We reformat the in-line conditional statements (e.g., the ternary conditional operator) into multi-line blocks. This ensures that each line of the program is one statement that belongs to one specific branch.\n• We remove all natural language comments.\nTargeted line/branch/path identification. To obtain targeted lines/branches, we first extract all conditional branches of a given program based on its abstract syntax tree (AST). Since loop branches (i.e., for/while loops) are usually easy to cover, we only consider conditional branches in our task.\nSpecifically, we extract all if, elif, and else branches. We refer to these branches as our targeted branches. Then, we consider all statements within these targeted branches as our targeted lines (see Figure 2 for the example). Overall, we identified 983 target branches in 210 programs under test (4.7 target branches per program on average). The total number of target lines in 210 programs is 1,312 (6.2 target lines per program on average). The de-tailed algorithm for extracting target lines/branches can be found in Appendix B.\nIn a given program under test, certain branches could be hard to cover without carefully crafting the test cases. Therefore, we label each targeted branch in a program as easy, medium, or hard according to the average coverage after executing 100 randomly generated inputs. For each problem in TESTEVAL, we construct a random input generator to assess the difficulties of covering a specific branch. Each gen-erator is a Python program that uniformly samples a valid test input for the LeetCode problem according to its constraint description. We leverage GPT-4 to generate these generators from the constraints in LeetCode problem descriptions. Then, we perform manual inspection and correction to ensure they adhere to the problem’s constraints. An example of an input generator is shown in Figure 4. These generators are then used to sample 100 executable test cases for each problem. Branch difficulty is determined by the frequency at which a branch is covered across theese 100 sampled test inputs. We categorize branches as follows: easy (covered by [99%, 100%] of test cases), medium (covered by [40%, 99%) of test cases), and hard (covered by [0, 40%) of test cases). This partitioning ensures that easy branches do not significantly outnumber other categories, and promotes a balanced distri-bution between medium and hard branches. The number of easy, medium, and hard target branches are 498, 225, and 260.\nFor the targeted path coverage task, as the num-ber of execution paths in a program can be enor-mous or even undecidable, it is impossible to col-3550 def generate_random_input(): # Define the constraints min_len = 1 max_len = 1000 min_val = -pow(10, 6) max_val = pow(10, 6) # Generate random length for two arrays within the constraints len_nums1 = random.randint(min_len, max_len) len_nums2 = random.randint(min_len, max_len) # Make sure the total length is within the limits while len_nums1+len_nums2>2000: len_nums1 = random.randint(min_len, max_len) len_nums2 = random.randint(min_len, max_len) # Create two lists with random int within the given value constraints nums1 = sorted([random.randint(min_val, max_val) for _ in range(len_nums1)]) nums2 = sorted([random.randint(min_val, max_val) for _ in range(len_nums2)]) # Return the resulting lists as a tuple return nums1, nums2 Constraints: * `nums1.length == m` * `nums2.length == n` * `0 <= m <= 1000` * `0 <= n <= 1000` * `1 <= m + n <= 2000` * `-10^6 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^6` Figure 4: The input constraints for a LeetCode problem (left) and its random input generator for TESTEVAL (right).\nlect all execution paths. Instead, we collect the target execution paths from the example test cases given by LeetCode problem descriptions. For each example test case, we execute it and record its exe-cution path using all the condition/loop branches it executed. The complete execution path would be too long and difficult for LLMs to understand, so we perform clipping after obtaining full paths. For each execution path, we randomly sample two sub-paths with lengths of 5 consecutive branches taken.\nWe further remove duplicated sampled paths, result-ing in an average of 4.1 target paths per problem.\n3 Evaluation 3.1 Experiment Setup We evaluate 17 popular instruction-following LLMs, including both commercial and open-source ones. The parameter sizes of open-source models range from 1.3B to 34B. The temperature is set to 0 or 1e-5 (for models on Huggingface that do not support temperature=0) to ensure that the evalua-tion results can be reproduced. All experiments on open-source LLMs are run on two NVIDIA A6000 GPUs. We set the length limit of outputs to 256 tokens. We use the pytest-cov (pytest cov) to measure the code coverage.\n3.2 Overall Coverage In this experiment, we query every model 20 rounds (N = 20) to generate test cases (one test case per round) for each program under test. Ta-ble 1 shows the evaluation results on the overall coverage task.\nRegarding correctness metrics, we observe that most models can achieve high syntactical and ac-ceptable execution correctness, but all models have much lower assertion correctness. For test cases that do not pass the execution correctness check, we perform a preliminary study in the Appendix C. Regarding the coverage performance, most of the LLMs are able to generate test cases that cover over 80% lines/branches per program under test. Notably, the latest GPT-4o achieves the best overall line (98.65%) and branch (97.16%) cover-age. We also notice that the open-source model, DeepSeek-coder-33b, outperforms the commercial LLM, Gemini-1.0-pro, on both overall line and branch coverage.\nWe further use cov@k to measure the diver-sity of each LLM’s generated test cases.\nSim-ilar to the overall coverage results, GPT-4o has the best line and branch cov@1, demonstrating its ability to craft complex test cases that are able to cover most of the program branches within a sin-gle attempt. We also find all LLMs have a higher cov@2 and cov@5 compared with cov@1. This indicates that the LLMs are able to generate dif-ferent test cases. Gemma-7b shows the most sig-nificant improvements in the line (+9.67%) and branch (+13.14%) cov@5 compared with its line and branch cov@1. We also notice that Starcoder-2-Instruct has the least improvement on cov@5 com-pared with cov@1 (+0.47% and +0.70% for line and branch coverage, respectively). By manually checking the test cases generated by Starcoder-2-Instruct, we find that it frequently repeats previ-ously generated cases despite being instructed to generate different ones.\n3.3 Targeted Line and Branch Coverage Table 2 and Table 3 show the evaluation results for the targeted line and branch coverage, respectively.\nFor each subject LLM, we also include a baseline by excluding the information about the targeted lines/branches in the text prompt.

The intuition is that, if an LLM could not outperform the baseline, it might be struggling with identify-ing the line/branch that is expected to cover when 3551 Table 1: Result on the overall coverage task.

The best-performing LLM is GPT-4o, reaching a cover-age accuracy of 80.97% on average. We also find that six out of seventeen LLMs do not improve over their baseline and seven LLMs only have marginal improvement (less than 5%). These results suggest that most LLMs may have trouble with multi-step reasoning. Specifically, to reach a specific line inside a branch, the LLM needs first to identify which branch the targeted line belongs to and then generate a valid test input to invoke this branch.\nWe observe a similar trend in the targeted branch coverage (Table 3). Specifically, the GPT-4 series has the best performance improvement (12%~15%) over their baselines. GPT-4o is the best-performing LLM, which can cover 80.87% branches, respec-tively.\nBy contrast, eight LLMs only exhibit marginal improvements and four LLMs do not im-prove compared with the baselines. Regarding branches with different difficulties, we find that branches more likely to be covered by random test cases are also easier for LLMs to cover (recall we use random testing to label each branch’s difficulty level in § 2.2). The GPT-4 series shows the smallest performance gap between branches with different difficulty levels. We also notice that twelve out of sixteen LLMs show the largest performance im-provements over the baselines on “hard” branches.\nThese results indicate that providing target branch information can indeed help us to cover branches that are hard to reach by random testing.\n3.4 Targeted Path Coverage Table 4 presents the results of the targeted path coverage task.

Overall, GPT-4o and Gemini-1.0-pro have the best perfor-mance on the path coverage, reaching 56.67% and 56.09% on average, respectively. However, they do not outperform their baselines. Generally, we do not find any LLMs that show obvious performance improvement (more than 5%) on the path coverage compared with the baselines. Nine out of sixteen LLMs do not outperform the baselines. Regarding the path similarity, we also do not find any LLMs exhibiting large performance improvement com-pared with the baselines. These results suggest that comprehending the program logic and identifying a specific execution path is still a challenging task for the current LLMs.\nTargeted path coverage is considerably more complicated compared with overall coverage and targeted line/branch coverage. Specifically, the LLM needs to identify a sequence of multiple branches, and create a test input that can execute these branches following a certain order, which is challenging even for human programmers.\n3.5 Advanced Prompting Advanced prompting techniques, such as in-context learning (Brown, 2020) and chain-of-thought (COT) (Wei et al., 2022), can improve the perfor-mance of LLMs on language understanding and generation. We further conduct a study on the influ-ence of different prompting strategies on TESTE-VAL. In this advanced prompt setting, we adopt an explicit two-step COT for the targeted line cov-erage task. LLMs are first asked to generate the conditions that need to be satisfied when the target line is executed. Then, we ask LLMs to generate a test case that satisfies these conditions. We pro-vide a one-shot example of the reasoning process, which is created from the solution of a LeetCode easy-level problem (not included in the TESTEVAL dataset). The complete prompt template for this setting is shown in Appendix A.5.\nTable 5 shows the results of our COT prompting on the targeted line coverage task. Because the cost of COT is significantly higher than basic prompting, we only run experiments on several cost-efficient models, and omitted expensive proprietary models or large open-source models. For most models (ex-cept GPT-4o-mini and DeepSeek-coder 6.7b), COT can improve the performances on target line cov-erage. This suggests that building more complex LLM pipelines or agents for test case generation is worth investigating in the future.\nWith the two-step COT setting, we can have a detailed analysis of the reason behind failures in generated test cases. Figure 5 demonstrates a test case generated by GPT-4o that failed to cover the target line: line 33. We find that although the LLM is capable of generating correct conditions (Fig-ure 5 (b)) for covering the target line, the generated test case did not satisfy those conditions, suggest-ing that the LLM’s code generation ability needs further improvement. In this case, the generated test case (Figure 5 (c)) does not satisfy the condi-3553 Table 4: Results for targeted path coverage.

One of the earliest attempts is HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), which consists of 164 hand-craft programming challenges that evalu-ate LLMs’ ability to understand natural language descriptions and generate the corresponding func-tional correct code. Since then, there have been several studies attempting to construct benchmarks with more diverse problems (Austin et al., 2021), more rigorous evaluations (Liu et al., 2024a), and more complex scenarios (Lai et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b). Beyond these estab-lished code-generation scenarios, numerous stud-ies are expanding their focus to include a broader range of real-world applications, such as reviewing code (Li et al., 2022), performing repo-level code completion (Liu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a; Guo et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2024), and resolv-ing GitHub issues (Jimenez et al., 2023). While all the aforementioned studies examine the coding abilities of LLMs from different perspectives, none specifically target test case generation, a crucial phase in the software engineering lifecycle. The most relevant study is DevBench (Li et al., 2024a), which evaluates LLMs across software develop-ment stages, including testing. Unlike DevBench, our benchmark provides more comprehensive eval-uations specifically tailored to test case generation using coverage-guided tasks and includes a broader range of studied models.\nLLMs for Software Testing. Recent studies have extensively utilized LLMs to develop efficient and effective testing pipelines for various software applications (Xia et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a).\nUnit test case generation (Schäfer et al., 2023), which aims to test individual software components independently, is the primary focus of current LLM-3554 aided software testing. One line of research tries to pre-train/fine-tune LLMs on focal methods and related assertion statements to enhance their test-generation capabilities (Alagarsamy et al., 2023; Hashtroudi et al., 2023; Rao et al., 2023; Steenhoek et al., 2023). Although effective, these methods can be cost-intensive and challenging to scale. Alterna-tively, some researchers focus on crafting effective prompts that instruct LLMs to analyze relevant information (Yuan et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Li and Doiron, 2023; Dakhel et al., 2024; Ryan et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b; Pizzorno and Berger, 2024; Wang et al., 2024b) or documentation (Vikram et al., 2023; Plein et al., 2024), or integrate LLMs with traditional software testing tools (Lemieux et al., 2023).\n5 Conclusion We present TESTEVAL, a novel benchmark for eval-uating automated test case generation with LLMs for Python programs. Based on this dataset, we pro-pose three different tasks and standardized evalua-tion pipelines. Our targeted coverage tasks enable the assessment on the LLM’s capabilities in com-prehending complex program logic and execution path and generating test cases following the tester’s intent, which is not considered in previous works on either code generation or test case generation with LLMs.\nWe further conduct extensive experiments with seventeen popular LLMs on TESTEVAL. We find that although LLMs can achieve high overall cover-age by generating diverse test cases, generating test cases to cover a specific element is still challenging.\nOur results reveal that there is a common lack of abilities in comprehending program logic among current LLMs, despite their promising performance on other code-related tasks (e.g., code generation).\nLimitations As a pioneering work of benchmarking LLM-based test case generation, our TESTEVAL still has a few limitations. Here, we will discuss these limitations and how we addressed them in our work (or in the future).\nFirst, the current TESTEVAL is only limited to Python. Although the solutions in LeetCode are written in multiple languages, we find that their adopted algorithm and logical structures are largely the same. We believe the behaviors of LLMs in other languages of LeetCode solutions will be sim-ilar to those of Python, which we aim to verify in the future.\nThe second limitation is that our TESTEVAL dataset is created from online programming prob-lems, which may be different from real-world sce-narios. We argue that at the current stage of LLM for test case generation, datasets from program-ming problems are still important. First, many LLMs in real-world test case generation still strug-gle with the correctness problem (whether the gen-erated test case can be executed), which makes it too early to consider the coverage problem. For example, in (Yuan et al., 2023), ChatGPT only achieves 42.1% success rate in compilation and 24.8% in execution. In contrast, on TESTEVAL, proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4 can achieve near 100% accuracies in execution (although some open-source LLMs still have difficulties in generating correctly formatted test cases), which allows re-searchers to focus on how to improve test cover-age. Second, compared to real-world software test-ing datasets, programs in TESTEVAL have more complex control flow structures, which allow us to have a deeper study on how LLMs can reason about branches/loops in programs. For example, the real-world Python test case generation dataset CodaMOSA (Lemieux et al., 2023) has an average cyclomatic complexity of 5.85, while the average complexity of our TESTEVAL dataset is 13.35.\nEthical Discussion Regarding the dataset, our dataset is built upon user-written solutions for LeetCode problems. These solutions are stored in a GitHub repository licensed with the MIT license, so we are granted permission to create our own dataset from this repository.\nRegarding the use of automated systems, the automatic tools we used to create our dataset are all rule-based tools with no bias introduced.\nThe research of LLMs for test case generation may encourage the software development industry to use LLMs instead of human developers for soft-ware testing. However, our findings in the paper suggest that existing LLMs still encounter various difficulties in generating correct test cases with ac-curate target test coverage. As software testing in real-world practice may introduce new questions not discussed in this paper, thus the impact of this paper on the industry community is still limited and not likely to cause major concerns.\nAlso, using LLMs for automated software test-3555 ing may raise security concerns. As our dataset only consists of self-contained, single-file pro-grams, there are no security vulnerabilities in our dataset that can be exploited by LLM-generated test cases. However, if we extend the scope of our dataset to real-world software in the future, the security of experiments should be carefully consid-ered.\nAcknowledgments This work was supported in part by Canada CI-FAR AI Chairs Program, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; JST CRONOS Grant (No.JPMJCS24K8), JSPS KAK-ENHI Grant (No.JP21H04877, No.JP23H03372, and No.JP24K02920); and the Autoware Founda-tion.\nReferences Saranya Alagarsamy, Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn, and Aldeida Aleti. 2023.

For the targeted line/branch/-path coverage tasks, we add line numbers to both the program under test and the target information in order to accurately locate the position of the tar-get line/branch/path. Notice that our prompt tem-plate is only a primary setting without advanced prompting techniques such as few-shot examples or chain-of-thought reasoning, and we encourage fu-ture researchers to design more advanced prompts for TESTEVAL.\nA.1 Prompt Template for Overall Coverage Please write a test method for the function ‘{func_name}’ given the following program under test and function description. Your an-swer should only contain one test input.\nProgram under test: —-{program} —-Function description for ‘{func_name}’: —-description —-Your test method should begin with: def test_func_name(): solution=Solution() Prompt for generating the next test case: Generate another test method for the function under test. Your answer must be different from previously-generated test cases, and should cover different statements and branches.\nA.2 Prompt Template for Targeted Line Coverage Please write a test method for the function ‘{func_name}’ given the following program under test and function description. Your an-swer should only contain one test input.\nProgram under test: —-{program} —-Function description for ‘{func_name}’: —-description —-Your test case must cover line {target_line}.\nYour test method should begin with: def test_func_name(): solution=Solution() A.3 Prompt Template for Targeted Branch Coverage Please write a test method for the function ‘{func_name}’ given the following program under test and function description. Your an-swer should only contain one test input.\nProgram under test: —-{program} —-Function description for ‘{func_name}’: —-description —-Your test case must cover the branch {tar-get_branch}.\nYour test method should begin with: def test_func_name(): solution=Solution() A.4 Prompt Template for Targeted Path Coverage Please write a test method for the function ‘{func_name}’ given the following program under test and function description. Your an-swer should only contain one test input.\nProgram under test: —-{program} —-Function description for ‘{func_name}’: —-description —-Your test case must cover the following execu-tion path in function {func_name}. The path is a sequence of branch conditions. When ex-ecuting your test case, each branch condition in the target execution path must be satisfied sequentially.\nTarget execution path: {target_path} —-Your test method should begin with: def test_func_name(): solution=Solution() A.5 Prompt Template for Two-step COT 3559 Prompt template for generating conditions in the two-step COT Given a Python code snippet and a target line number, you are asked to generate reasoning steps to satisfy a specific line to be executed.\n[Example] Given the following code snippet: ```Python class Solution: #1 def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: #2 numMap = #3 n = len(nums) #4 #5 for i in range(n): #6 numMap[nums[i]] = i #7 #8 for i in range(n): #9 complement = target - nums[i] #10 if complement in numMap and numMap[complement] != i: #11 return [i, numMap[complement]] #12 #13 return [] #14 ``` Identify when executing funtion twoSum, what conditions need to be satisfied if line 12 is to be executed.\nAnswer: <cond> Step 1: If line 12 ‘return [i, numMap[complement]]‘ is executed, then the ‘if‘ condition ‘(complement in numMap and numMap[complement] != i)‘ in line 11 shoud be true.\nStep 2: If condition ‘complement in numMap‘ is true, at least one ‘target - nums[i]‘ in line 10 equals an element in nums, which means there exists two elements in ‘nums‘ that their sum is equal to ‘target‘.\nStep 3: If condition ‘numMap[complement] != i‘ is ture, then ‘numMap[target - nums[i]] != i‘, meaning that the index of ‘target - nums[i]‘ is not equal to ‘i‘.\nStep 4: Generally, to execute line 12, we need to ensure that there exists two different elements in ‘nums‘ that their sum is equal to ‘target‘.\n<\\cond> [\\Example] In a similar fashion, identify the conditions that need to be satisfied when line targetline is to be executed for the following Python code.\n```Python {program} ``` Surround your answer with <cond> and <\\cond>.\n3560 Prompt template for generating test case in the two-step COT For the given code snippet and a list of conditions need to be satisfied, generate a test case that will satisfiy these conditions. Here is an example: [Example] Code: ```Python class Solution: #1 def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: #2 numMap = #3 n = len(nums) #4 #5 for i in range(n): #6 numMap[nums[i]] = i #7 #8 for i in range(n): #9 complement = target - nums[i] #10 if complement in numMap and numMap[complement] != i: #11 return [i, numMap[complement]] #12 #13 return [] #14 ``` Conditions: Step 1: If line 12 ‘return [i, numMap[complement]]‘ is executed, then the ‘if‘ condition ‘(complement in numMap and numMap[complement] != i)‘ in line 11 shoud be true.\nStep 2: If condition ‘complement in numMap‘ is true, at least one ‘target - nums[i]‘ in line 10 equals an element in nums, which means there exists two elements in ‘nums‘ that their sum is equal to ‘target‘.\nStep 3: If condition ‘numMap[complement] != i‘ is ture, then ‘numMap[target - nums[i]] != i‘, meaning that the index of ‘target - nums[i]‘ is not equal to ‘i‘.\nStep 4: Generally, to execute line 12, we need to ensure that there exists two different elements in ‘nums‘ that their sum is equal to ‘target‘.\nGenerated test case: ```Python def test_twoSum(): solution = Solution() assert solution.twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9) == [0, 1] ``` [\\Example] In a similar fashion, generate a test case for the following code snippet and conditions. Your test function should be named ‘test_func_name‘. Code: ```Python {program} ``` Conditions: {conditions} You should only generate the test case, without any additional explanation.\n3561 B Targeted Line/Branch Identification The complete algorithm for extracting targeted lines/branches from a program under test is shown in Algorithm 2. At a high level, we first extract all conditional branches by locating the branches start-ing with conditional operators (i.e., ‘if’, ‘elif’, and ‘else’) through parsing the program’s abstract syntax tree. For each branch, we record the line numbers of its first and last lines (e.g., Lines 1:5) as one targeted branch. Then, we record the line numbers of all lines (except the line that only in-cludes the ‘else’ operator) within this branch as the targeted lines (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). We repeat this process until finishing parsing all branches of a program.\nAlgorithm 2: Targeted Line/Branch Identi-fication.\nInput: Program with L lines: p = {s1, s2, ..., sL} Output: Target lines ls, target branches bs ls = [], bs = [], i = 1; while i <= L do if si starts with ‘if’, ‘elif’, or ‘else’ then curent_branch = [] ; j = i ; repeat curent_branch.append(j) ; j = j + 1 until sj not in this branch; bs.append(curent_branch); end end for target_branch in bs do for line si in target_branch do if si is inside a branch and not si starts with ’else’ then ls.append(i); end end end return ls, bs C Error Analysis For the failure of LLMs in generating test cases that failed to execute, we choose Llama3 as the example. Figure 6 shows several examples of failed test cases generated by Llama 3. Figure 6 (a) shows an example with a slight syntax error: it generated def test_isMatch(): solution=Solution() assert not solution.isMatch(\\"aa\\", \\"a*\\"), Errors in raw test cases result in all errors in Llama3 def test_getSubarrayBeauty(): solution=Solution() nums = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -(a): format error (b): overlength test case Figure 6: Examples of erroneous test cases generated by LLMs.\na redundant comma at the end of the last statement.\nFigure 6 (b) is another common type of error: the LLM generates an endless statement by repeating a simple pattern. In our post-processing statements, we remove the last statement if it is uncompilable.\nThese erroneous statements are removed and result in empty test cases, which are counted as execution errors. We find that all execution errors in Llama 3-8b for targeted line coverage are made up of these two types of errors.\nD Data Leakage Analysis We choose GPT-4o as an example to study the potential of data leakage. The training data of GPT-4o covers up to October 2023, so we filter the problems from our dataset released after Oct 2023, which results in a total of 21 problems. Cor-respondingly, we also create a subset with 21 oldest problems which are released before Oct 2023.\nFor the problems released after Oct 2023, in their 49 official test cases, we found none of them ap-peared in the generated test cases. On the contrary, for the 21 problems before Oct 2023, 35 out of 52 official test cases have been found in the generated test cases. However, as the LLM has generated 20 different test cases for each problem (which means 420 test cases for 21 problems), the issue of copy-ing official test cases is minor. We further measure the overall coverage for all problems before/after Oct 2023, the results are shown in Table 6.\nTable 6: Coverage metrics of the overall coverage task with data source before and after Oct 2023.\nModel Before Oct 2023 After Oct 2023 line branch line branch GPT-4o 98.74 97.24 97.79 96.38 We can see that the coverage metrics before/after Oct 2023 are similar, indicating that potential data leakage is not a major concern of TestEval.\n3562'), SearchResult(url='https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-models-examples/', title='10+ Large Language Model Examples &

norms](https://aimultiple.com/commitments)\n\nWe have used open-source [benchmarks](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-model-evaluation/) to compare top proprietary and open-source large language model (LLM) examples. You can choose your use case to find the right model for it.\n\nComparison of the most popular large language models\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have created a model scoring system using 3 metrics: User preference, coding, and reliability. You can also see the price graph with respect to the final score of the model. You can adjust the criterion weights by using the sliders on top of the graph according to your needs:\n\n**User preference:** This [metric is based on the Elo score](https://research.aimultiple.com/how-to-measure-ai-performance/). Elo score is a widely used technique in various areas that need ranking. It originates from chess, and when a player outranks the other, they gain more scores. We have obtained this data from Chatbot Arena, which includes many users. [1](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-models-examples/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-632781 "https://openlm.ai/chatbot-arena/")\n\n**Coding:** The [coding](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-coding-benchmark/) metric indicates the code generation abilities of the LLM rated by users of OpenLM.ai.[2](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-models-examples/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-632782 "https://openlm.ai/chatbot-arena/")\n\n**Reliability:** The reliability metric refers to the hallucination scores of the study conducted by Vectera. They use the Hughes Hallucination Model Evaluation to find out how often a model introduces hallucinations when summarizing a document. [3](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-models-examples/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-632783 "https://huggingface.co/vectara/hallucination_evaluation_model")\n\n**API cost** is given for 1000000 input and output tokens per API call for 1 API call.\n\nYou can see our [methodology](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-models-examples/#evaluation-method) and further information on evaluation.\n\nExamples of leading large language models\n-----------------------------------------\n\nUpdated at 03-13-2025\n\n| **Developer** | **Model** | **Open Source** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| OpenAI | GPT-4.5-preview | ❌ |\n| xAI | Grok-3-preview | ✅ |\n| Google | Gemini-2.0-Flash | ❌ |\n| OpenAI | GPT-4o | ❌ |\n| OpenAI | o3-mini | ❌ |\n| OpenAI | o1 | ❌ |\n| Alibaba | Qwen2.5-Max | ✅ |\n| Anthropic | Claude 3.7 Sonnet | ❌ |\n| DeepSeek | DeepSeek-V3 | ✅ |\n| DeepSeek | DeepSeek-R1 | ✅ |\n| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | ❌ |\n| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Haiku | ❌ |\n| Anthropic | Claude 3 Opus | ❌ |\n| Google | Gemma 2B | ✅ |\n| Google | Gemini 1.5 Pro | ❌ |\n| Meta | Llama 3.3 | ✅ |\n| Mistral | Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411 | ❌ |\n| Mistral | Pixtral-Large-Instruct-2411 | ❌ |\n| Mistral | Mistral-Small-Base-2501 | ✅ |\n| OpenAI | o1-mini | ❌ |\n\nThe first 11 models were sorted according to the default comparison scores, and the rest were sorted alphabetically by the developer names.\n\nThe table features vendors selected from the most popular general-purpose LLMs as they can handle various topics and tasks.

We have used user preference and coding scores from OpenLM’s Chatbot Arena and the reliability score from Vectera’s study to achieve consistent results. Although we have used external sources for the metrics now, we plan to use our benchmarks for different categories in the future.\n\nWe used min-max normalization for our scoreboard in this evaluation since all of these scores had different evaluation intervals. This means that the highest scoring model got 100%, and the lowest scoring model got 0% for the specific metric.\n\n### Benchmarks\n\nOur researchers have conducted benchmarks for different metrics:\n\n*   For [top coding models](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-code/), we used 100 math problems suitable for an advanced high school student. These problems assess both logical reasoning and coding skills.\n*   For [the most reliable models](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-hallucination/), we assessed an LLM’s reliability in retrieving precise numerical value answers from news stories on various topics; the answers were fact-checked against ground truth to ensure accuracy in exact figures rather than generalizations.\n*   Our [AI reasoning benchmark](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-reasoning/) tested 100 mathematics questions in a zero-shot setting, meaning no example questions were used for training. It evaluated reasoning models and compared them with non-reasoning models to highlight their differences.\n\n### LLM pricing\n\nWe have an article to help you understand the [pricing methods of LLMs.](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-pricing/) Pricing structures vary by provider, but per-token pricing is the most common. To assist with cost estimation, our [LLM API Price Calculator](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-pricing/#llm-api-price-calculator) allows you to input your token volume needs and sort results by input cost, output cost, and total cost. This tool provides a clear breakdown of pricing based on usage, enabling informed decision-making.\n\nReal-life use cases for large language models (LLMs)\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nHere are key use cases of LLM models with examples.

Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods,\nwe demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical.\nTo address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding.\nBy integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds.\nOur work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.\n\nFaster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling\n\nZili Wang1,2††thanks: Equal contribution.,\nTianyu Zhang3∗,\nLei Zhu3,†,\nHaoli Bai3,\n\nLu Hou3,\nShiming Xiang1,2,†,\nXianzhi Yu3,\nWulong Liu3\n\n1 School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China\n\n2 Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China\n\n3 Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab\n\nwangzili2022@ia.ac.cn,\u2003{zhangtianyu59,zhulei168}@huawei.com\n\n![[Uncaptioned image]](x1.png)\n![Refer to caption](x2.png)\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTest-Time Scaling (TTS) is an effective approach to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at the cost of additional inference-time computations\xa0Snell et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib24)); Brown et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib5)).\nTTS can be realized by two basic approaches: sequential scaling and parallel scaling.\nSequential scaling requires the model to produce an extended reasoning process in a single pass\xa0Muennighoff et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib18)). In contrast, parallel scaling generates multiple solutions in parallel and selects the final answer, usually through majority voting\xa0Wang et\xa0al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib28)); Liu et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib16)). Hybrid approaches can be constructed on top of the two basic ones\xa0Guan et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib8)); Wang et\xa0al. ([2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib27)).\n\nWith the number of generated tokens (#tokens) as budget, many existing studies\xa0Snell et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib24)); Setlur et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib22)); Yang et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib30)); Liu et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib16)); Shi and Jin ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib23)); Zhang et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib32)) have examined compute-optimal strategies that enhance average performance gain per token, a metric we refer to as *token efficiency*.\nHowever, in latency-sensitive scenarios where small batch sizes are employed, *“compute-optimal” does not necessarily translate to “latency-optimal”*.\nThis discrepancy is because the performance achieved within a limited time is determined by token efficiency as well as the throughput (*i.e*., average number of output tokens per second).\nAs shown in Figure\xa0[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling"), for s1.1-32B\xa0Muennighoff et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib18)) model, although sequential scaling has a better token efficiency, achieving a similar performance with 9×\\times× fewer tokens compared to parallel scaling, it turns out that parallel scaling achieves 1.6×\\times× lower latency.\nIn fact, under small batch sizes, the time of an LLM autoregressive decoding step is dominated by the memory access of the parameters. Therefore, a moderately increased number of parallel branches incurs little additional latency, allowing a much higher throughput almost for free, as shown in Figure\xa0[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S1.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling").\n\n![Refer to caption](x3.png)\n\nWe then ask *how we can achieve latency-optimal test-time scaling*.\nOne lesson from the observation above is that, in addition to optimizing token efficiency, attention must be given to improving the generation concurrency to chase a throughput.\nThere are two approaches to improving concurrency: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which increases the number of parallel branches B𝐵Bitalic\\_B, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, which generates multiple successive tokens for a sequence in a single forward pass with speculative decoding\xa0Leviathan et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib12)); Chen et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib7)).\nHowever, current research lacks a thorough analysis of how to allocate computational power to these two resource-competing approaches and to what extent they can be improved.\n\nTo bridge the gap, we examine the impact of concurrency configuration for latency-aware test-time scaling in this study.\nSpecifically, we conduct experiments on representative datasets including MATH-500\xa0Hendrycks et\xa0al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib10)), AIME24\xa0AoPS ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib2)), AIME25\xa0AoPS ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib3)), and GPQA-Diamond\xa0Rein et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib21)) across model sizes from 3B to 32B\nand under varied concurrency configurations.\nRevealed by our experiments and analyses, the latency-optimal concurrency depends on the comparative advantage of token efficiency in sequential scaling and parallel scaling.\nFor models with higher token efficiency with parallel scaling (*e.g*., LLaMa-3.1-8B-Instruct\xa0Meta ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib17))), one should prioritize branch-wise parallelism.\nOtherwise (*e.g*., for QwQ-32B\xa0Team ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib25))) sequence-wise parallelism takes priority.\nBesides, under a latency constraint of 1 minute, an optimal concurrency configuration can provide up to 7.3% better performance than baselines where only a single parallelism is applied.\n\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\nWe introduce latency-aware test-time scaling, which considers the performance scaling under latency constraints. Unlike existing works that prominently only focus on token efficiency, we discover the necessity of taking systemic throughput into consideration for a better latency-performance trade-off.\n\nWe provide a unified view for parallel branches and speculative decoding from the perspective of generation concurrency. This allows us to frame latency-optimal test-time scaling as a resource allocation problem.\n\nThrough extensive experiments, we explore the optimal concurrency configuration for latency-aware test-time scaling. Our experiments reveal that for s1.1-32B, an optimal concurrency configuration can improve the accuracy by 7.3% while reducing latency by 1.7×\\times×, reaching 82.3% on MATH-500 in 1 minute.\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\n#### Test-time scaling\n\nScaling the compute at inference time has been proven to be a prominent approach to improve the performance of LLMs. Generally, test-time scaling methods fall into two main categories: sequential and parallel scaling.\nFor the former, sequential scaling methods, represented by OpenAI’s o1\xa0OpenAI ([September 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib20)), DeepSeek-R1\xa0Guo et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib9)), and Qwen QwQ\xa0Team ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib25)), enforce the model to generate longer solutions with a detailed reasoning chain.\nSuch an ability can be incentivized with supervised training\xa0Nye et\xa0al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib19)); Lee et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib11)); Muennighoff et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib18)) or reinforcement learning\xa0Guo et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib9)).\nAnother main category is parallel scaling. This method first generates multiple response candidates in parallel, then applies a selection criterion to identify the best output.\nRecent research primarily uses token count as a metric to measure the budget of test-time scaling\xa0Snell et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib24)); Setlur et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib22)); Yang et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib30)). Different from previous works, our work points out that compute-optimal does not necessarily translate to latency-optimal. We introduce latency-aware test-time scaling and figure out the concurrency configuration to latency-optimal TTS.\n\n#### Speculative decoding\n\nSpeculative decoding uses a small draft model to generate several draft tokens autoregressively, and the target model to verify them in parallel while ensuring a lossless acceleration\xa0Leviathan et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib12)); Chen et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib7)). Many studies have proposed improvements to speculative decoding. EAGLE-series\xa0Li et\xa0al. ([2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib14), [a](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib13), [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib15)), Medusa\xa0Cai et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib6)), and Hydra\xa0Ankner et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib1)) employ features from the target model for better draft acceptance rate. HASS\xa0Zhang et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib31)) mitigates the inconsistency between training and inference by simulating the multi-step draft generation in the training phase. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of latency-aware TTS optimization through speculative decoding, presenting it as one viable approach to latency-optimal TTS.\n\n## 3 Rethinking Test-Time Scaling with Latency\n\nPrevious works measure the budget of LLM test-time scaling by #tokens. However, it provides an incomplete evaluation, particularly when considering real-world deployment constraints. Our investigation reveals the necessity to consider latency-aware TTS in latency-sensitive scenarios.\n\n![Refer to caption](x4.png)\n\n### 3.1 Latency-Aware Test-time Scaling\n\nThe inference of LLMs on modern accelerators is a memory-bound process, constrained by memory bandwidth. Nowadays, LLMs have billions of parameters\xa0Bai et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib4)); Yang et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib29)); Team ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib25)); Guo et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib9)); Meta ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib17)). In the autoregressive decoding, parameters (weights & KV caches) are loaded from memory (e.g., HBM on a GPU) into the compute units (e.g., SMs on a GPU) for matrix multiplication and other arithmetic operations. The runtime paid for the iteration is dominated by memory access. This is called the memory-bound nature of LLM. Under memory-bound constraints, slightly increasing the computation overhead does not affect the inference latency, but can increase throughput, as shown in Figure\xa0[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S1.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling").\n\nTo characterize latency-aware test-time scaling under the memory-bound scenario, we explicitly consider two key factors:\n\nToken efficiency is the ratio of task-specific accuracy improvement per token generated by the LLM, measured by %/token. A high token efficiency indicates that each token contributes significantly to achieving the accuracy. Prior work’s approach to determining compute-optimal TTS using #token as budget fundamentally represents a search for maximal token efficiency.\n\nThroughput is the number of output tokens generated per wall-clock time, measured by token/s. Note that the throughput may vary as the sequence length grows. A high throughput indicates efficient use of hardware resources and the system’s capacity to quickly handle a large volume of tokens.\n\nConsider s1.1-32B\xa0Muennighoff et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib18)) as an example. Figure\xa0[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling") compares the accuracy-#token and accuracy-latency curves of sequential and parallel scaling. Sequential scaling achieves higher token efficiency (83.3%/211.3superscript211.32^{11.3}2 start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 11.3 end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPTtoks) than parallel scaling (83.3%/214.4superscript214.42^{14.4}2 start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 14.4 end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPTtoks), but Figure\xa0[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S1.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling") reveals its throughput is 16×16\\times16 × lower. Consequently, sequential scaling requires 1.6×1.6\\times1.6 × more time to attain comparable accuracy. This suggests that while sequential scaling improves token efficiency, its inferior throughput hinders better accuracy in limited time. Thus, test-time scaling budgets must consider both token efficiency and throughput to achieve high accuracy with low latency.\n\n### 3.2 How to Improve Latency-Aware TTS? A Concurrency Perspective\n\nTo improve latency-aware TTS, the key insight is to improve generation concurrency to increase throughput. To this end, there exist two approaches from the perspective of concurrency:\n\n#### Branch-wise Parallelism.\n\nOne approach is employing multiple concurrent branches B𝐵Bitalic\\_B for the question, as shown in Figure\xa0[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S3.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 3 Rethinking Test-Time Scaling with Latency ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling") (b). For instance, when a 2048-token response fails to yield a correct answer, users can infer more branches to generate multiple responses of the same length and determine the final answer through majority voting. This approach harnesses more underutilized memory-bound computational resources, introducing almost no extra latency. Employing multiple branches to explore diverse reasoning paths brings further improvements of TTS performance.\n\n#### Sequence-wise Parallelism\n\nAnother effective approach is speculative decoding\xa0Leviathan et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib12)); Chen et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib7)), as shown in Figure\xa0[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S3.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 3 Rethinking Test-Time Scaling with Latency ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling") (c). SD accelerates by verifying multiple draft tokens concurrently, leveraging underutilized memory-bound computational resources to mitigate the memory access burden in sequential generation with lossless performance. With SD, LLM can generate longer responses within a limited time, thereby enhancing TTS performance.\n\nThe combination of the two approaches is illustrated in Figure\xa0[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S3.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 3 Rethinking Test-Time Scaling with Latency ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling") (d). Branch-wise parallelism enhances performance without increasing latency, elevating the scaling curve. Sequence-wise parallelism reduces latency without compromising performance, causing the scaling curve to shift leftward. Their combined effect moves the scaling curve toward the upper-left quadrant.\n\n### 3.3 Latency-Optimal Test-Time Scaling\n\nThe joint application of both approaches increases the overall concurrency and introduces additional computational overhead. When this overhead surpasses memory access overhead, the system transitions into a compute-bound state, leading to more latency. Besides, branch-wise parallelism exhibits diminishing improvement with increasing branches, while sequence-wise parallelism’s acceleration reaches a maximum threshold. Consequently, an optimal boundary curve represents the latency-optimal test-time scaling, as shown by the green curve in Figure\xa0[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S3.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 3 Rethinking Test-Time Scaling with Latency ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling") (d). This curve defines where neither latency nor accuracy can be further improved without concurrency trade-offs.\n\nWe aim to determine the latency-optimal TTS strategy by allocating concurrency resources with parallel branches B𝐵Bitalic\\_B and draft length γ𝛾\\gammaitalic\\_γ.

Also, to implement speculative decoding, we select model types with draft models available. Therefore, considering its scalability, we employ s1.1-32B as our test-time scaling baseline. s1.1-7B is used as its draft model for speculative decoding. Also, we conduct relevant experiments on LLaMa-3.1-8B-Instruct\xa0Meta ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib17)) with Eagle3\xa0Li et\xa0al.

([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib9)) and QwQ-32B\xa0Team ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib25)) for their superior reasoning ability. The DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B is used as their draft model. We employ s1.1-3B for small-sized LLM for its outstanding model size and excellent performance with Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct\xa0Bai et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib4)) as the draft model. To better control the output sequence length, we employ budget forcing\xa0Muennighoff et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib18)) as an appropriate method to enforce the model to generate longer CoT. We use majority voting\xa0Wang et\xa0al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib28)) to select the answer. Experiments are conducted on the codebase of OpenR\xa0Wang et\xa0al. ([2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib26)).\n\n### 4.2 Sequential and Parallel Scaling under Latency-Aware TTS\n\n#### Sequential scaling suffer from low throughput.\n\nAs shown in Figure\xa0[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling"), sequential scaling achieves superior performance across most model types. However, its impact is less pronounced for models not explicitly trained for long CoT reasoning, such as LLaMa-3.1-8B-Instruct\xa0Meta ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib17)). Conversely, Figure\xa0[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S1.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling") reveals that sequential scaling exhibits lower throughput. For instance, the s1.1-32B model processes only 22.7 tokens/s, translating to approximately 1,000 tokens per minute. While sequential scaling demonstrates better token efficiency, its lower throughput makes it less effective than parallel scaling under time constraints. Consequently, sequential scaling struggles to generate sufficient tokens to attain high accuracy.\n\n#### Parallel scaling improves fast, but limited.\n\nIn Figure\xa0[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling"), parallel scaling shows lower token efficiency than sequential scaling for most models except LLaMa-3.1-8B-Instruct. However, from Figure\xa0[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S1.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling"), increasing the branches of LLM inference hardly requires extra latency. Specifically, when increasing branches from 1 to 16, s1.1-32B gains nearly 10%percent1010\\%10 % improvement on MATH-500 at almost no extra latency cost. This can be attributed to the fact that the computation resources are fully utilized. By inference in branches, one autoregressive decoding procedure would generate the branches’ tokens, but the latency cost of developing one token by sequential scaling is the same. So parallel scaling can reach a larger #token faster. When the branches are increased to 64, the performance gain becomes slight, and the latency slightly grows because of the large amount of KV cache. Overall, parallel scaling maximizes hardware parallelism and scales output tokens simultaneously. But, parallel scaling often yields suboptimal accuracy due to branch redundancy and limited scalability.\n\n#### Mostly, parallel scaling can surpass sequential scaling within limited time period.\n\nAs shown in Figure\xa0[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling"), merely employing parallel scaling can surpass sequential scaling within a shorter, limited time. However, the extent of performance improvement varies depending on the model type. Specifically, for reasoning models like QwQ-32B, parallel scaling reaches 80.1%percent80.180.1\\%80.1 % accuracy on the MATH-500 dataset within 30303030 seconds, but sequential scaling requires 1.4×1.4\\times1.4 × more time to achieve the comparable performance. Sequential scaling shows a slight performance gain for LLaMa-3.1-8B-Instruct, which is not designed for long CoT reasoning. While parallel scaling is still effective on MATH-500 since it explores more diverse solution paths, it shows obvious token efficiency, and sequential scaling cannot surpass it. Overall, parallel scaling can surpass sequential scaling w.r.t. latency, reaching a comparable accuracy within a relatively short time.\n\n### 4.3 The Impact of Branch-wise Parallelism for Latency-Aware TTS\n\nWe conduct experiments on sequential scaling with varying branch sizes. In these configurations, we implement sequential scaling in parallel, with all parallel branches aggregated through majority voting. As shown in Figure\xa0[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S3.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 3.3 Latency-Optimal Test-Time Scaling ‣ 3 Rethinking Test-Time Scaling with Latency ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling"), s1.1-32B demonstrates an initial upward trend in the TTS curve as the number of branches increases, indicating effective performance improvements. However, when the branch size grows excessively, the performance gains diminish, and latency increases slightly due to the non-negligible overhead of KV cache. In contrast, LLaMa-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits minimal sequential scaling effects, resulting in a flatter curve compared to s1.1-32B and QwQ. Nevertheless, parallel scaling proves impactful, yielding an accuracy improvement that elevates the curve.\n\n| Strategy | 1024 | | 2048 | | 4096 | | 8192 | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lat.\xa0(s) | Acc.\xa0(%) | Lat.\xa0(s) | Acc.\xa0(%) | Lat.\xa0(s) | Acc.\xa0(%) | Lat.\xa0(s) | Acc.\xa0(%) |\n| Baseline | 96.2 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.2 | 75.0 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.6 | 157.9 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.5 | 83.4 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.2 | 280.6 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.5 | 84.9 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.8 | 419.5 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.7 | 85.4 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.9 |\n| Bnh-wise | 96.7 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.2 | 79.4 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.7 | 159.2 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.8 | 86.2 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.1 | 284.5 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.3 | 88.3 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.5 | 428.0 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.6 | 89.6 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.0 |\n| Seq-wise | 55.5 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.4 | 75.0 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.3 | 91.1 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.3 | 83.4 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.9 | 161.9 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.3 | 84.9 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.4 | 241.9 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.8 | 85.4 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.1 |\n| Lat-Opt. | 57.2 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.4 | 82.3 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.8 | 95.9 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.3 | 85.9 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.7 | 179.1 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.4 | 91.7 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.3 | 283.1 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.6 | 92.7 ±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.3 |\n| Improve | 1.7×\\times× | 7.3+ | 1.6×\\times× | 2.5+ | 1.6×\\times× | 6.8+ | 1.5×\\times× | 7.3+ |\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.2\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.7\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.8\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.1\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.3\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.5\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.6\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.0\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.4\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.3\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.3\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.9\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.3\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±1.4\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.8\n\n±plus-or-minus\\pm±0.1\n\n![Refer to caption](x9.png)\n![Refer to caption](x10.png)\n\n### 4.4 The Impact of Sequence-wise Parallelism for Latency-Aware TTS\n\nSpeculative decoding can accelerate model inference to some extent while preserving accuracy. As shown in Figure\xa0[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S3.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 3.3 Latency-Optimal Test-Time Scaling ‣ 3 Rethinking Test-Time Scaling with Latency ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling"), most scaling curves with speculative decoding are on the left side of the baseline curve. As the speed-up ratio grows, the left-shifted trend becomes more obvious. However, when the draft length γ𝛾\\gammaitalic\\_γ becomes large, the speed-up ratio would decay, slowing down the overall speed. In our experiments, QwQ-32B is the target model, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B as the draft model, achieving a maximum speed-up ratio of 1.64×1.64\\times1.64 ×. Therefore, the scaling curve moves to the left first and then to the right. Sequential scaling with speculative decoding can achieve 7.5%percent7.57.5\\%7.5 % higher accuracy than the baseline curve for a limited time. These results demonstrate that employing a proper draft length γ𝛾\\gammaitalic\\_γ can push the inference speed to an optimal stage, enabling further sequential scaling within a limited time.\n\n### 4.5 Latency-Optimal TTS with Branch-wise and Sequence-wise Parallelism\n\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments with various parallel branches and draft lengths to identify the concurrency configuration to achieve latency-optimal TTS. The results are shown in Figure\xa0[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S3.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ 3.3 Latency-Optimal Test-Time Scaling ‣ 3 Rethinking Test-Time Scaling with Latency ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling") and\xa0[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S3.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ 3.3 Latency-Optimal Test-Time Scaling ‣ 3 Rethinking Test-Time Scaling with Latency ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling"). For LLMs that benefit primarily from sequential scaling, speculative decoding emerges as the dominant factor in the latency-optimal configuration. Conversely, for LLMs hat exhibit improvements from branches, increasing the number of branches yields huge performance gains. This difference stems from the different token efficiency. For reasoning models like QwQ, accuracy improvements are achieved through long CoT, making better SD acceleration more advantageous within limited time. In contrast, models like LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, which do not benefit from long CoT, using more branches to expand the search paths is more efficient. See appendix for detailed configurations.\n\n## 5 Results under Latency-Optimal TTS\n\n### 5.1 Can LLM Solve the Problem in 1 minute?\n\nAchieving as high accuracy as possible within a limited time holds significant practical value. We aim to find out how TTS can improve the accuracy individually on the device side within a relatively short time limitation, like 1 minute. To this end, we comprehensively evaluate s1.1-32B and s1.1-3B w.r.t. latency and record their inference latency.\n\nFrom Figures\xa0[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S4.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ 4.3 The Impact of Branch-wise Parallelism for Latency-Aware TTS ‣ 4 Experiments and Discussion ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling") and\xa0[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S4.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ 4.3 The Impact of Branch-wise Parallelism for Latency-Aware TTS ‣ 4 Experiments and Discussion ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling"), we derive the following observations: (1) Large model like s1.1-32B, achieves relatively high accuracy within just 1 minute, which is unattainable by the baseline. (2) Smaller model (s1.1-3B) attains notable accuracy in merely 10 seconds, showing significant potential. This trend persists across datasets spanning diverse domains, suggesting that popular models can be optimized using the latency-optimal TTS strategy.\n\n### 5.2 How Can Latency-Optimal Improve Compared with Baseline?\n\nBased on previous findings of latency-optimal TTS with different model types, branches, and draft lengths, we summarize the results in Table\xa0[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#S4.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 4.3 The Impact of Branch-wise Parallelism for Latency-Aware TTS ‣ 4 Experiments and Discussion ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling"). For s1.1-32B on MATH-500, we find that latency-optimal TTS can achieve 6%percent66\\%6 % accuracy improvement on average than merely using sequence-wise parallelism, and 1.6×1.6\\times1.6 × on average faster than branch-wise parallelism. Latency-optimal TTS outperforms the baseline in both accuracy and latency to a noticeable degree. However, increased branch and draft length causes LLMs to enter a compute-bound regime, where computational overhead exceeds memory access overhead. This eliminates the benefits of parallelism, leading to increased latency and sometimes even worse than the baseline. This suggests that a latency-optimal TTS strategy requires extremely fine-grained parameter tuning.\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we propose to rethink test-time scaling in latency-sensitive scenarios. We show that compute-optimal does not always result in latency-optimal under such conditions due to memory-bound constraint. To address this, we propose to improve TTS on generation concurrency to maximize throughput from a unified view. Specifically, we present two approaches: (1) branch-wise parallelism via multiple branches and (2) sequence-wise parallelism by speculative decoding, along with their combinations. Furthermore, we investigate the concurrency allocation strategy to balance these approaches for latency-optimal TTS. Experimental results show that latency-optimal TTS enables 32B model to achieve 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute, while 3B model attains notable accuracy within just 10 seconds, showing significant improvements in both speed and accuracy.\n\n## 7 Limitations\n\nThe basic concept of this paper is that the inference of LLM is a memory-bound process. However, this concept holds on small (like mobile phones, personal computers) or medium (like work stations) scale hardware. For large-scale servers, which deals with hundreds or thousands of requests at one time, the main bottleneck of inference is computation, and the budget of inference can be measured by #tokens. However, the studies on small and medium scale hardware still hold significant meaning, as the practical budget measured on these platforms is often under memory-bound scenarios.\n\nThe maximum sequence length in our experiment settings is 8192. Note that, as the number of branches and sequence length increase, the substantial memory access burden imposed by the KV cache leads to a significant rise in latency. This causes methods that increase concurrency to experience corresponding increases in latency. Additionally, longer sequence lengths may introduce performance degradation due to excessive context length in the model\xa0Muennighoff et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#bib.bib18)). Since our work adopts relatively common experimental configurations, these issues have not manifested prominently, and thus our proposed method and conclusions remain valid.\n\n## References\n\n## Appendix A Appendix\n\n### A.1 Why does the parallel scaling curve exhibit a steeper slope than the sequential scaling?\n\nThis result can be attributed to the heavy model weights of LLM under the measurement of memory access. For instance, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct has 32 billion parameters, so the model weights is 64GB. While the total KV cache at sequence length 1024 and batch size 1 is 0.25GB. Under this condition, KV cache only accounts for a small portion of memory access. When parallel scaling can easily extend branches with a small budget by 0.25GB per branch with 1024 length, sequential scaling tries hard to load the whole model weights of the entire 64GB just for 1 more extended token. This extreme imbalance on memory access makes parallel scaling significantly advantageous regarding memory access. In contrast, sequential scaling suffers from high memory access costs.\n\n### A.2 Additional Results\n\nWe present additional experimental results. The results on the influence of branch-wise parallelism is shown in Figure\xa0[11](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.19634v3#A1.F11 "Figure 11 ‣ A.2 Additional Results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling").

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ['Challenges and Limitations in LLM Benchmarking\n\nRigorous benchmarking is integral to the progress of large language models (LLMs), providing standardized methods for evaluation, comparison, and continual advancement. Nevertheless, the process of benchmarking LLMs is marred by pivotal challenges involving fairness, standardization, dataset biases, model robustness, benchmark obsolescence, and the disconnect between benchmark performance and real-world deployment. This section provides a comprehensive analysis of these obstacles, integrating foundational concepts, empirical findings, benchmark case studies, and contemporary industry practices.\n\nFairness and Standardization: Foundational Concerns\n\nEnsuring fairness and rigorous standardization are foundational for any benchmarking regime aimed at high-stakes AI technologies. Fairness in LLM benchmarking entails that evaluations do not systematically disadvantage particular demographic groups or reinforce harmful societal stereotypes, whether by language, gender, race, nationality, or other axes of identity. However, prevailing benchmarks often have data and task distributions dominated by English and Western perspectives, which can lead to models that perform disproportionately well on tasks reflective of these distributions while neglecting others. For example, comprehensive studies have found that benchmarks such as GLUE or the Winograd Schema Challenge contain underrepresentation of non-English languages and limited intersectional demographic scenarios.\n\nStandardization involves constructing uniform datasets, protocols, and evaluation metrics that enable consistent and reproducible comparison across models and research groups. Initiatives like GLUE, SuperGLUE, and Stanford’s HELM have advanced the field by introducing widely-recognized test suites and best practices. However, challenges persist—models may inadvertently (or deliberately) be pre-trained on publicly available benchmark data (“data contamination”), resulting in test set leakage and artificially inflated results. Moreover, subtle differences in prompt phrasing, dataset curation, or evaluation criteria can impede cross-benchmark comparability.\n\nFairness and standardization are further complicated by the breadth of tasks LLMs now address, spanning text generation, reasoning, translation, code synthesis, and ethical judgment. No single test suite captures this full spectrum, making holistic benchmarking elusive. The need for unbiased, multilingual, and multidisciplinary benchmarks—combined with stringent documentation of dataset provenance and stricter protocol enforcement—remains acute.\n\nBias in Benchmark Datasets and Its Ripple Effects\n\nBenchmark datasets reflect the biases encoded in their source text. This problem manifests on several levels: content imbalances (overrepresenting or underrepresenting demographic groups), evaluation procedure biases (e.g., LLMs as automatic evaluators show egocentric and attentional biases), and the risk of cognitive biases misaligning model evaluation from human judgment. Notable datasets such as StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs have empirically demonstrated how gender, race, occupation, and nationality stereotypes persist in model outputs, mirroring biases in the underlying data.\n\nMore insidiously, automated evaluation methods leveraging LLMs as judges are susceptible to cognitive biases such as order bias, compassion fade, bandwagon effect, and egocentric bias. Studies (e.g., CoBBLEr) reveal that model-based evaluators diverge significantly from human annotators, registering agreement rates as low as 44% (measured by rank-biased overlap). Not only does this introduce unreliability into assessments, but increases with model size do not reliably mitigate these biases—in some cases, they intensify.\n\nCrucially, static benchmarks frequently miss intersectional and adversarial biases. Traditional fairness benchmarks are typically structured around ideal use cases and do not probe how LLMs handle malicious or edge-case prompts. Emerging adversarial benchmarks like FLEX go further, evaluating models in scenarios with persona injection, competing objectives, or adversarial prompt rephrasing. Results from these benchmarks indicate that most open-access models remain acutely vulnerable to bias induction, with attack success rates (ASR) ranging from 48% to over 80% for common models.\n\nEvolving Benchmarks to Match Technological Progress\n\nThe velocity of LLM innovation far exceeds the rate at which legacy benchmarks can adapt. Core benchmarks such as GLUE and SuperGLUE have been rapidly saturated, with state-of-the-art models matching or exceeding human-level scores—often assisted by data contamination. Newer LLMs like GPT-4 display capabilities in few-shot learning, code generation, multimodal input handling, and long-context reasoning, all of which lie beyond the scope of many current benchmarking tools.\n\nThis dynamic has catalyzed the development of expanded benchmark suites, such as MMLU (focusing on massive multitask learning), BigBench (diverse, multidisciplinary tasks), and HELM (multi-metric holistic evaluation). Yet, these too exhibit limitations: MMLU is vulnerable to pre-training leakage; BigBench’s sheer scope renders comprehensive evaluation challenging and sometimes impractical; TruthfulQA, while adversarial, can be gamed by models memorizing adversarial prompts. Furthermore, static tests remain insufficient for assessing agentic abilities, dynamic dialogue, or real-time tool integration—critical features in real-world usage.\n\nTo remain relevant, benchmarks must be adaptive, domain-aware, and continuously curated. Emerging approaches include continuous generation of adversarial examples, automated monitoring of model responses in deployment (with feedback loops), and integration of more complex evaluation tasks covering multi-modal, multi-turn, and real-world scenarios.\n\nDisconnect Between Benchmark Performance and Real-World Applications\n\nA persistent criticism of LLM benchmarking is its weak alignment with real-world application requirements. Standardized evaluations typically deploy short-answer, multiple-choice, or narrow factual recall formats in controlled conditions. In contrast, LLM deployment contexts are characterized by:\n\n- Ambiguous or noisy data (e.g., customer support dialogues, clinical notes)\n- Long-context, multi-turn interactions (e.g., legal document drafting, iterative troubleshooting)\n- Need for robustness to distributional shifts, adversarial prompts, or malicious actors\n- Compliance with real-world safety, ethical, and privacy standards\n- High contextuality and user adaptation (e.g., domain-specific expertise, handling corrections)\n\nNumerous industry case studies and deployment experiences report that benchmark leaders often underperform on criteria valued by end users, such as conversational fluency, sustained memory, explainability, and safe handling of edge cases. Additionally, public contamination of standard benchmarks reduces their relevance for business-critical, domain-specific applications. This has led organizations to develop proprietary, contamination-free evaluation datasets—tailored to their operational context and incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback—to ensure practical utility and reliability.\n\nRecognizing these shortcomings, there is an expanding movement toward holistic, application-oriented evaluation, utilizing a blend of custom test sets, real-user studies, continuous error tracking, and domain-calibrated metrics in addition to public leaderboard comparisons.\n\nContemporary Approaches and Future Trajectories\n\nAddressing the challenges of fairness, standardization, bias, evolution, and real-world alignment necessitates multi-pronged solutions:\n\n- Custom, application-relevant evaluation protocols: While universal benchmarks aid comparison, organizations increasingly supplement these with private, task-specific datasets reflecting operational objectives and regulatory requirements.\n- Multi-metric, multi-faceted evaluation systems: Platforms like Stanford’s HELM exemplify this trend, evaluating models not only on accuracy but calibration, robustness, bias, and toxicity.\n- Integration of adversarial robustness and intersectional fairness testing: Adversarial benchmarks (e.g., FLEX) and intersectional diagnostic tools are indispensable for exposing model vulnerabilities and reducing real-world risk.\n- Combining human and automated evaluation: Both human raters and advanced LLMs as judges are used, but the propagation of model-specific biases through automated judging underscores the need for cross-calibration and continuous oversight.\n- Dynamic benchmarking loops: Deployment environments now include active monitoring systems that collect user feedback, track model failure modes, and provide continuous performance updates for on-the-fly adjustment.\n\nSummary Table of Major Benchmarks, Targeted Abilities, and Key Limitations\n\n| Benchmark      | Evaluated Capability     | Test Format             | Core Limitations                   | Data Contamination Risk |\n|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| GLUE           | Language understanding  | Mixed                   | Saturated by SOTA models           | High                   |\n| MMLU           | Knowledge/reasoning     | Multi-choice            | Limited to knowledge, contamination| High                   |\n| HellaSwag      | Commonsense reasoning   | Multi-choice, adversarial| Narrow focus, pattern exploitation | Moderate               |\n| TruthfulQA     | Truthfulness, misinformation | Multi-choice, open    | Small, potentially gamed           | High                   |\n| BIG-Bench      | Broad/general ability   | Suite (varied)          | Diversity at expense of focus      | Moderate               |\n| FLEX           | Bias robustness         | MC/adversarial          | New, robustness focus, less utility| Low                    |\n| StereoSet      | Demographic bias        | Multi-choice            | Partial view of bias               | Moderate               |\n| CoBBLEr        | Evaluator bias          | Pairwise ranking        | Evaluates bias, not user experience| New                    |\n\nFormulae Relevant to Benchmark Assessment\n\n- **Attack Success Rate (ASR) in FLEX**:  \n    \\( ASR = \\frac{\\#\\text{ of items correct in clean benchmark but incorrect under attack}}{\\#\\text{ items correct in clean benchmark}} \\)\n- **Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO)**:  \n    \\( RBO(H, L) = (1-p) \\sum_{d=1}^{13} p^{d-1} \\frac{|A[1:d] \\cap B[1:d]|}{d} \\), where p parameters top-rank weighting.\n\nPerspectives and Ongoing Debates\n\nThe field grapples with several open questions: the tradeoff between standardized benchmarks fostering comparability versus custom evaluations enabling application-relevance; the balance between public, transparent test data and the need to prevent data contamination; the merits and dangers of LLMs as evaluators compared to human rater-based assessment; and how rapidly benchmarks, protocols, and datasets must evolve to keep pace with the rapidly shifting LLM landscape.\n\nCommunity-wide collaborative efforts are converging on principles of transparency, adaptability, ethical oversight, and continuous benchmarking improvement. As adversarial and real-world-inspired benchmarks become more widespread, and as organizations compete to optimize models for both leaderboard metrics and lived user experience, the benchmarking ecosystem will remain central—but must also continually reform itself to retain scientific and practical legitimacy.'], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='fairness and standardization challenges in LLM benchmarking'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://giancarlomori.substack.com/p/main-challenges-in-establishing-benchmarks', title='Main Challenges in Establishing Benchmarks and Measuring LLM ...', raw_content="Published Time: 2024-06-03T20:14:24+00:00\n\nMain Challenges in Establishing Benchmarks and Measuring LLM Performance \n\n===============\n\n[![Image 1: AI Uncovered](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5d6696-67c5-41bc-9633-268840850097_264x264.png)](https://giancarlomori.substack.com/)\n\n[AI Uncovered](https://giancarlomori.substack.com/)\n===================================================\n\nSubscribe Sign in\n\n#### Share this post\n\n[![Image 2](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_520,h_272,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c57c45-b9be-4723-aea8-77d37e2bf919_1456x816.png) ![Image 3: AI Uncovered](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_36,h_36,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d5d6696-67c5-41bc-9633-268840850097_264x264.png) AI Uncovered Main Challenges in Establishing Benchmarks and Measuring LLM Performance](https://substack.com/home/post/p-145271526?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)\n\nCopy link Facebook Email Notes More\n\n![Image 4: User's avatar](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_64,h_64,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b09388-61b2-4a21-9f07-662ac3650441_881x881.jpeg)\n\nDiscover more from AI Uncovered\n\nAI Uncovered by Giancarlo Mori presents various artificial intelligence topics like AI News, Generative AI, Enterprise AI, and more. \n\nOver 1,000 subscribers\n\nSubscribe\n\nBy subscribing, I agree to Substack's [Terms of Use](https://substack.com/tos), and acknowledge its [Information Collection Notice](https://substack.com/ccpa#personal-data-collected) and [Privacy Policy](https://substack.com/privacy).\n\n \n\nAlready have an account?

These benchmarks provide a way to compare different models and track advancements in the field. They typically encompass a range of tasks, from natural language understanding and generation to more specialized applications like code generation and commonsense reasoning.\n\nThe primary purpose of LLM benchmarks is to provide a consistent and objective measure of a model’s capabilities. They help researchers and developers understand the strengths and weaknesses of different models, guiding further improvements and innovations. Benchmarks also play a crucial role in ensuring that models are robust, fair, and generalizable across different domains and applications.\n\n### **Defining the Top Benchmarks**\n\n[![Image 9](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F246124ae-a795-49d9-a655-969f7559d864_1094x1530.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F246124ae-a795-49d9-a655-969f7559d864_1094x1530.png)\n\n**The Challenges of Establishing LLM Benchmarks and Measuring LLMs**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Diversity of Tasks**\n\nLLMs are utilized across a wide array of tasks, each with unique requirements and evaluation criteria. These tasks range from basic text generation and language translation to more complex functions such as summarization, question answering, code generation, and commonsense reasoning. The diversity in tasks makes it difficult to create benchmarks that comprehensively cover all aspects of LLM capabilities. Each task demands a different set of skills from the model, necessitating a variety of evaluation parameters to accurately measure performance.\n\nFor instance, a benchmark designed to assess text generation might focus on creativity and coherence, while a benchmark for translation would emphasize accuracy and fluency. Summarization tasks require models to condense information without losing context, which involves a different skill set. Creating a single benchmark that can effectively evaluate all these varied tasks poses a significant challenge.\n\n### **Dynamic Nature of Language**\n\nLanguage is not static; it constantly evolves. New slang, terminology, and usage patterns emerge regularly, influenced by cultural shifts, technological advancements, and social changes. This dynamic nature makes it challenging to develop static benchmarks that remain relevant over time. Benchmarks must be adaptable to capture the evolving nature of language and ensure that LLMs remain effective and accurate in their understanding and generation of text.\n\nConsider the rapid rise of internet slang and abbreviations. Once non-existent words and phrases have now entered common usage relatively quickly. A benchmark created a few years ago might not account for these terms, making it less effective in evaluating a model's current performance. Continuous updates to benchmarks are necessary to reflect these changes and provide accurate assessments of LLM capabilities.\n\n### Benchmarks vs. Metrics\n\nBefore continuing, it might be useful to define the difference between “benchmarks” and “metrics.” Here are simple definitions: **Benchmarks** include multiple tasks and use various metrics to provide a holistic evaluation of LLMs. **Metrics**, on the other hand, offer precise numerical scores for each task, facilitating detailed performance analysis and comparison.\n\nThese definitions will make digesting the rest of the article much easier.\n\n### **Evaluation Metrics**\n\nSelecting appropriate metrics to evaluate LLMs is a complex challenge. Traditional metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, BLEU, and ROUGE are commonly used to measure performance. However, these metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced aspects of language understanding and generation. They primarily focus on quantitative aspects and may not adequately reflect qualitative factors like coherence, creativity, and context understanding.\n\n**Examples of Metrics:**\n\n*   **Precision and Recall:** Measure accuracy in information retrieval tasks.\n\n*   **F1 Score:** Balances precision and recall.\n\n*   **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** Commonly used for machine translation.\n\n*   **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** Used for summarization tasks.\n\nDespite their widespread use, these metrics have limitations. For example, BLEU and ROUGE scores might not effectively capture the semantic accuracy and contextual appropriateness of translations and summaries. There is a need for more sophisticated evaluation methods that can assess the broader and deeper aspects of language processing, such as contextual relevance, user satisfaction, and conversational fluency.\n\n### **Bias and Fairness**\n\nEnsuring that benchmarks do not perpetuate biases is a critical challenge in the development and evaluation of LLMs. Biases related to gender, race, and culture can be embedded in the training data and, consequently, reflected in the model's outputs. Benchmarks must be designed to detect and mitigate these biases to ensure that LLMs provide fair and unbiased results.\n\nBias in LLMs can manifest in various ways, such as generating stereotypical responses or favoring certain demographic groups over others. For instance, a model might generate more positive descriptions for traditionally male-dominated professions while neglecting or misrepresenting female professionals. To address this, benchmarks need to include diverse and representative datasets and implement measures to identify and correct biased outputs.\n\n### **Scalability**\n\nAs LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, the scalability of benchmarks becomes a significant concern. Larger models require more computational resources for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. This increased demand poses challenges for researchers and developers in terms of time, cost, and technical infrastructure. Efficient testing protocols are essential to manage these constraints without compromising the thoroughness and accuracy of evaluations.\n\nEvaluating a model like GPT-4, which consists of billions of parameters, requires substantial computational power and time. The process of running comprehensive benchmarks on such large models can be resource-intensive, making it challenging to perform frequent and extensive evaluations. Developing scalable benchmarks that can handle the demands of increasingly complex models is crucial for maintaining the pace of innovation and ensuring robust performance assessments.\n\n[![Image 10](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f89e8f1-8ee9-472e-ae4a-cc3d8b847779_1456x816.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f89e8f1-8ee9-472e-ae4a-cc3d8b847779_1456x816.png)\n\nOriginal Midjourney creation\n\n**Future Directions and Recommendations**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nTo address the current challenges in benchmarking LLMs, there is a pressing need for the development of innovative benchmarks that reflect the diverse and dynamic nature of language and its applications. These benchmarks should be designed to evaluate a broader spectrum of tasks and incorporate adaptive mechanisms that can evolve alongside advancements in language modeling.\n\nOne approach is to develop benchmarks with more diverse datasets, encompassing a wider range of languages, dialects, and cultural contexts. This would ensure that LLMs are evaluated on their ability to understand and generate text across different linguistic and cultural settings. Additionally, adaptive benchmarks that update periodically to include new linguistic phenomena, such as emerging slang or new technical jargon, can keep the evaluation process relevant and comprehensive.\n\n### **Improved Evaluation Metrics**\n\nExisting evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of language understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs. Therefore, there is a need for more sophisticated metrics that can provide a deeper and more nuanced assessment of LLM performance.\n\nFuture metrics should aim to capture aspects such as context, coherence, and creativity. For instance, metrics that evaluate contextual relevance could assess how well a model maintains context across long conversations or complex narratives. Coherence metrics could measure the logical flow and consistency of generated text, while creativity metrics might evaluate the novelty and originality of responses. Incorporating human-like scoring systems and integrating user feedback can also enhance the robustness and reliability of these evaluations.\n\n### **Addressing Bias**\n\nBias in LLMs remains a significant concern, and benchmarks must be designed to identify and mitigate these biases to ensure fair and unbiased outcomes. Effective strategies are needed to address biases related to gender, race, ethnicity, and culture that can inadvertently be propagated through LLMs.\n\nOne strategy is to use more representative datasets that include a diverse array of voices and perspectives. This can help ensure that LLMs are trained on a balanced set of data that reflects the broad spectrum of human experience. Additionally, implementing bias detection algorithms during the benchmarking process can identify biased outputs, allowing for corrective measures to be taken. Regular audits and updates of datasets and benchmarks to remove or mitigate biases are also crucial steps in this direction.\n\nBy developing innovative benchmarks, improving evaluation metrics, and addressing bias, the AI community can significantly enhance the benchmarking and performance evaluation of LLMs. These advancements will ensure that LLMs are not only technically proficient but also fair, reliable, and valuable across diverse real-world applications. The collaborative effort of researchers, developers, and stakeholders is essential to drive these improvements and shape the future of AI and language modeling.\n\n**Charting the Future of LLM Evaluation**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn this piece, we explored the critical challenges associated with establishing benchmarks for LLMs and measuring their performance. Overcoming the challenges of benchmarking and evaluating LLMs is crucial for the advancement of artificial intelligence. Effective benchmarks ensure that LLMs are reliable, fair, and capable of handling diverse tasks in real-world scenarios.\n\nAs LLMs become more integrated into various applications, from customer service chatbots to automated translation and content creation, it is imperative that their performance is rigorously and comprehensively assessed. Addressing these challenges will lead to more robust, accurate, and unbiased LLMs, ultimately enhancing their utility and impact across different sectors.\n\nThe development of better benchmarks and evaluation methods for LLMs requires a collaborative effort from the AI community, but also extensive feedback from users at large. Researchers, developers, and stakeholders must work together to create innovative benchmarks that reflect the evolving nature of language and its applications. There is also a need to develop more sophisticated evaluation metrics that capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities and address inherent biases. By pooling resources and expertise, the AI community can drive the advancements needed to ensure that LLMs are not only cutting-edge but also ethical and equitable in their applications.\n\n* * *\n\n**Keep a lookout for the next edition of AI Uncovered.**\n\n**Follow on[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mvylassociates),[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mvyl-associates/?viewAsMember=true),and[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mvylassociates/)for more AI-related content!**\n\nThanks for reading AI Uncovered!

7 LLM Benchmarks for Performance, Capabilities, and Limitations\n\nLLMs (Large Language Models) have the potential to transform your business, bringing tremendous value through efficiency, innovation, and deeper customer engagement. But without the proper safeguards, they can cause more harm than good. Misinterpreted customer queries, biased outputs, or AI-driven decisions that backfire can spark public outrage, damage reputations, and trigger regulatory scrutiny.\n\nLeaders are paying attention.[Nearly half of CEOs](https://aibusiness.com/responsible-ai/accuracy-bias-in-ai-concerns-most-ceos-ibm-study)\xa0are concerned about AI accuracy and bias. These leaders understand that even minor lapses can lead to widespread consequences---disrupting operations, alienating customers, and exposing organizations to compliance violations.\n\nLLM benchmarks offer a solution that systematically tests a model's performance, reasoning, and limitations. These evaluations help teams identify and address flaws before they become costly problems. Here's a closer look at the benchmarks driving better, fairer, and more effective AI.\n\n## What Are LLM Benchmarks?\n\nLLM benchmarks are the crucible where large language models prove their mettle. These standardized frameworks [evaluate everything](https://www.citrusx.ai/posts/6-essential-steps-for-a-useful-llm-evaluation)\xa0from raw performance and reasoning skills to critical limitations like bias and hallucination risks.\n\nBenchmarking tests simulate real-world tasks, like interpreting sentiment in customer interactions or reasoning through regulatory compliance scenarios, and stack a model's output against well-defined metrics.\n\nLLM benchmarks play a critical role in building AI models that are both reliable and responsible. They cut through the noise by offering a straightforward way to compare models and pick the right one for the job.\n\nBut it's not just about performance---benchmarks help flag potential problems like bias or hallucinations early in development, saving teams from more significant headaches down the line. For industries dealing with heavy regulations, LLM benchmarks provide the proof needed to show that a model meets transparency and accountability standards.\n\n[![llm benchmark ](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdxd4zhyvszhsr8qhfcq2.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdxd4zhyvszhsr8qhfcq2.png)\n\n![llm benchmark ](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdxd4zhyvszhsr8qhfcq2.png)\n\n[Source](https://medium.com/@vipra_singh/building-llm-applications-evaluation-part-8-fcfa2f22bd1c)\n\n## Who Uses LLM Benchmarks?\n\nLLM benchmarks provide a common ground that bridges technical precision, compliance needs, and business impact in industries like finance, healthcare, or customer service. Here are some of the roles that employ them:\n\nTechnical Teams\xa0use LLM benchmarks to fine-tune model accuracy, evaluate performance under real-world conditions, and spot weaknesses early in development.\n\nCompliance Officers\xa0rely on benchmarks to validate fairness, mitigate risks, and meet regulatory requirements in high-stakes industries.\n\nBusiness Stakeholders\xa0leverage LLM benchmarks to clarify how models align with business goals, deliver ROI, and support operational strategies.\n\n## LLM Benchmarking: Why It's Critical to AI Model Success\n\nAI initiatives are costly, high-stakes investments, and the success of any model directly impacts everything from operational efficiency to regulatory compliance. Without the proper evaluation methods, organizations risk deploying models that fail to deliver business value---or worse, cause reputational and financial damage.\n\nThe benefits of LLM benchmarking include:\n\n[Mitigating reputational risks](https://www.citrusx.ai/posts/the-definitive-guide-to-model-risk-management)\xa0through early detection of ethical challenges, such as bias or misinformation, before they escalate.\n\nAligning AI with strategic outcomes\xa0by linking model performance to measurable KPIs like customer satisfaction or operational efficiency.\n\nProviding clear metrics\xa0for evaluating the business impact of AI investments, making ROI analysis more concrete.\n\nHighlighting optimization opportunities that expose gaps in performance, robustness, and domain-specific capabilities. For example, in fields like [materials informatics](https://www.materials.zone/blog/what-is-material-informatics), benchmarks ensure that LLMs can accurately synthesize research findings, predict material behaviors, and support innovation.\n\n[![achieving ai model success ](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4hpkftckhievrmq5bszm.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4hpkftckhievrmq5bszm.png)\n\n![achieving ai model success ](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4hpkftckhievrmq5bszm.png)\n\nEnabling rigorous comparisons of models\xa0through standardized tests for speed, accuracy, and edge case handling.\n\nPinpointing weaknesses that can guide retraining or architectural improvements for better fine-tuning strategies.\n\nValidating regulatory alignment\xa0with measurable evidence of fairness, accuracy, and transparency using tools like StereoSet and TruthfulQA.\n\nSimplifying compliance processes\xa0that help organizations meet audit and regulatory requirements under frameworks like[ISO 42001](https://www.citrusx.ai/posts/iso-42001-what-is-it-and-7-steps-to-comply)\xa0or the[EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/).\n\nStrengthening stakeholder trust\xa0through clear evidence that deployed models are ethical, reliable, and compliant.\n\n--\n\n## Types of LLM Benchmarks\n\nLLM benchmarks give a clear picture of how a model performs across different dimensions, helping teams understand what a model does well, where it struggles, and whether it's ready for the real world. Each type of LLM benchmark focuses on a different aspect of a model's performance, capabilities, and limitations.\n\n#### Performance Benchmarks\n\nPerformance benchmarks measure the fundamentals: how fast, accurate, and consistent a model is at handling core tasks like natural language understanding or text classification. These tests simulate varied conditions to see how the model holds up under pressure, making them critical for assessing scalability and reliability in production environments.\n\n#### Capability Benchmarks\n\nThese benchmarks test the model's ability to go beyond surface-level tasks, focusing on reasoning, multitasking, and generalization. For industries like finance or healthcare, where queries often involve domain-specific complexity, capability benchmarks reveal if the model can adapt and provide meaningful, accurate responses.\n\nIn [AI-driven cybersecurity](https://www.memcyco.com/how-ai-is-being-used-to-improve-cybersecurity/)\xa0solutions, while specialized datasets are typically used for domain-specific evaluations, capability benchmarks can provide insight into a model's potential to analyze patterns, interpret threat data, or support decision-making processes in threat mitigation.\n\n[![llm benchmark types and focus areas ](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fro34aysxgqazcifrwgwu.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fro34aysxgqazcifrwgwu.png)\n\n![llm benchmark types and focus areas ](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fro34aysxgqazcifrwgwu.png)\n\n#### Limitation Benchmarks\n\nLimitation benchmarks are designed to uncover issues like biases, hallucinations, or factual inaccuracies. These tests are critical for identifying risks early, particularly in high-stakes environments where errors could lead to reputational or regulatory fallout.\n\n## 7 LLM Benchmarks for Performance, Capabilities, and Limitations\n\n--\n\n### Performance Benchmarks\n\n#### 1. [SuperGLUE](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/)\n\nSuperGLUE\xa0evaluates[natural language understanding (NLU)](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/natural-language-understanding-nlu)\xa0through tasks like sentiment analysis, reading comprehension, and question answering.\n\nBy presenting challenges like multiple-choice questions and logical reasoning, SuperGLUE tests whether a model truly grasps language, not just at a surface level but in context. For chatbots and virtual assistants, this benchmark separates the contenders from the pretenders.\n\n[![coarse grained categories ](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0fb8yic133khol69a85h.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0fb8yic133khol69a85h.png)\n\n![coarse grained categories ](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0fb8yic133khol69a85h.png)\n\n[Source](https://medium.com/@myschang/benchmark-of-llms-part-1-glue-superglue-adversarial-nli-big-bench-8d1aed6bae12)\n\n#### 2. [XTREME](https://github.com/google-research/xtreme)\n\nXTREME\xa0tests multilingual and cross-lingual performance by evaluating tasks like document retrieval, translation, and sentiment classification.

[MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mmlu)\n\nMMLU\xa0challenges models with reasoning tasks across 57 domains like humanities, STEM, and social sciences.\xa0 The benchmark presents domain-specific questions that demand applied reasoning, testing whether a model can synthesize and apply knowledge rather than rely on rote patterns.\n\nFinance:\xa0Can the model make sense of complex regulations, dissect financial scenarios, or help with risk analysis?\n\nHealthcare:\xa0Does it understand medical research, interpret clinical guidelines, or offer insights for treatment decisions tailored to individual patients?\n\nEducation:\xa0Can it create high-quality teaching materials, assist with curriculum design, or provide precise answers to domain-specific questions from students?\n\nLegal:\xa0How well does it navigate case law, draft legal arguments, or assist with detailed research for complex cases?\n\n[![MMLU Score model ](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvgeusn5s1jqvk8h8012c.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvgeusn5s1jqvk8h8012c.png)\n\n![MMLU Score model ](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvgeusn5s1jqvk8h8012c.png)\n\n[Source](https://www.bracai.eu/post/mmlu-benchmark)\n\n#### 4. [HellaSwag](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/hellaswag)\n\nHellaSwag focuses on commonsense reasoning, requiring models to predict the most logical continuation of a given scenario. Tasks include filling in the blanks for sentences or understanding situational context. This benchmark sharpens a model's ability to handle open-ended and user-driven queries. Applications like customer support systems or knowledge platforms benefit greatly from models that perform well here.\n\n#### 5. [BBH (Big-Bench Hard)](https://github.com/suzgunmirac/BIG-Bench-Hard)\n\nBBH takes models through higher-order reasoning with ambiguous, multi-step challenges. These 23 scenarios are designed to stretch the limits of LLM capabilities, testing their ability to handle advanced problem-solving.\n\nFor example, tasks might require a model to solve intricate puzzles or derive answers from layered datasets where dependencies between inputs must be carefully navigated. It tests whether models can retain context across steps and produce coherent, logically sound outputs.\n\nBHH's[Chain-of-Thought (CoT)](https://ssahuupgrad-93226.medium.com/llm-benchmarks-explained-everything-on-mmlu-hellaswag-bbh-and-beyond-c67b37b744f0)\xa0prompting has been shown to improve performance significantly, guiding models to produce structured, step-by-step answers.\n\n### Limitation Benchmarks\n\n#### 6. [StereoSet](https://github.com/moinnadeem/StereoSet)\n\nStereoSet\xa0evaluates demographic biases in a model's outputs, focusing on areas like gender, ethnicity, and cultural stereotypes. It tests whether models unintentionally reinforce or amplify harmful associations, offering a structured way to address fairness challenges.\n\nThis evaluation asks the following questions:\n\nDoes the model associate specific professions with particular genders?\n\nAre certain ethnicities portrayed in stereotypical contexts more frequently than others?\n\nDoes the model's tone or phrasing shift depending on demographic cues in the input?\n\nThese insights are essential for building systems that meet fairness standards and regulatory requirements, especially in industries where unbiased decision-making is critical, like hiring platforms, credit assessments, or customer service [AI companies](https://mvpgrow.com/top-generative-ai-startups/).\n\n#### 7. [TruthfulQA](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA)\n\nTruthfulQA\xa0measures how reliably a model can generate accurate responses to over 800 complex, knowledge-driven questions while identifying instances of hallucination -- responses that may appear credible but lack factual basis. It helps ensure that a model maintains credibility in knowledge-intensive applications.\n\n[![questions and answers from truthful QA and gpt-3](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fn8l88h09y6ns9vvd9wca.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fn8l88h09y6ns9vvd9wca.png)\n\n![questions and answers from truthful QA and gpt-3](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fn8l88h09y6ns9vvd9wca.png)\n\n[Source](https://arize.com/blog-course/llm-leaderboards-benchmarks/)\n\nFor example, a hallucination might occur if a model is asked about a specific financial regulation and confidently provides a plausible-sounding explanation for a law that doesn't actually exist. In healthcare, it might invent details about a treatment protocol or cite a nonexistent clinical study, potentially leading to harmful decisions if relied upon.\n\n--\n\n## Build an LLM You Can Trust with Citrusˣ\n\nLLM benchmarks are your roadmap for deploying AI systems that are accurate, ethical, and ready for real-world challenges.

These advancements concurrently underscore the need for rigorous safety evaluations due to the manifestation of social biases, which can lead to harmful societal impacts. Despite these concerns, existing benchmarks may overlook the intrinsic weaknesses of LLMs, which can generate biased responses even with simple adversarial instructions. To address this critical gap, we introduce a new benchmark, Fairness Benchmark in LLM under Extreme Scenarios (FLEX), designed to test whether LLMs can sustain fairness even when exposed to prompts constructed to induce bias. To thoroughly evaluate the robustness of LLMs, we integrate prompts that amplify potential biases into the fairness assessment. Comparative experiments between FLEX and existing benchmarks demonstrate that traditional evaluations may underestimate the inherent risks in models. This highlights the need for more stringent LLM evaluation benchmarks to guarantee safety and fairness.

While these models provide users with more information and improved experiences, they also more directly expose social biases, raising concerns about the safety of LLMs\xa0Weidinger et\xa0al.

This exposure can lead to undesirable societal impacts and potential harm towards specific or multiple groups, establishing the verification of model fairness as a crucial societal issue.\n\n![Refer to caption](x1.png)\n\nNumerous studies focus on developing benchmarks to evaluate the social stereotypes embedded in models concerning categories such as gender, race, age, etc\xa0Parrish et\xa0al.

([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib36)).\nExisting benchmarks primarily evaluate the safety of models by assessing whether the model selects or generates unbiased responses without additional instructions. This approach implicitly assumes well-intentioned users and assesses fairness from a highly typical and idealized scenario.\n\n![Refer to caption](x2.png)\n\nHowever, recent studies reveal that LLMs can easily be compromised by attacks involving simple prompt modifications\xa0Wei et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib38)); Kumar et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib15)); Yuan et\xa0al. ([2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib46)); Dong et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib5)), as illustrated in Figure\xa0[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"). Given that LLMs should maintain neutrality even in bias-inducing situations, this suggests that existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating their ethical robustness and fail to guarantee their absolute safety.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose a new benchmark, FLEX (Fairness Benchmark in LLM under Extreme Scenarios). FLEX is designed to rigorously assess the fairness of LLMs when subjected to conditions that are likely to induce bias. By employing adversarial attacks, we expose hidden biases that may not be surface in traditional benchmarks.\nThese adversarial inputs simulate challenging real-world conditions, providing a more realistic evaluation of how well models maintain fairness.\nThrough this approach, we can better identify vulnerabilities and areas for improvement, ensuring that LLMs handle extreme scenarios without amplifying biases.\n\nWe use adversarial prompts designed to elicit biased perceptions in LLMs, based on renowned fairness benchmark datasets such as BBQ\xa0Parrish et\xa0al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib27)), CrowS-Pairs\xa0Nangia et\xa0al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib22)) and SteroSet\xa0Nadeem et\xa0al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib21)). We reconstruct existing Question Answering\xa0(QA) datasets by adding prompts that potentially lead the model to select biased responses. For questions previously answered correctly, we extract scenarios in which GPT-3.5\xa0OpenAI ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib24)) generated biased responses through five rounds of prompt injections. Instead of simply adding scenarios to each sample, we assign the one that can induce the most significant bias for each sample. This allows us to rigorously assess the ability of the model to maintain fairness and neutrality even in environments that significantly increase the likelihood of biased responses from LLMs.\n\nWith our benchmark, we conduct experiments to evaluate fairness across three categories targeting LLMs. By comparing the results from FLEX with those from the source datasets, we demonstrate that the assessments of traditional fairness benchmarks do not guarantee safety in extreme scenarios. Furthermore, despite the early recognition of the issue posed by the most straightforward prompt injection containing competing objectives, it is revealed that most LLMs still fail to address it. Our findings underscore that the fairness of LLMs may be overestimated, indicating that even if LLMs are perceived as relatively safe under existing benchmarks, they may still be easily exposed to risks in different scenarios.\n\n## 2 Related Works\n\n### 2.1 Fairness Benchmark\n\nThe interest in identifying unfairness caused by models is concretized into methods that evaluate the model’s responses under specific hypothetical situations.\nVarious types of fairness benchmarks have been proposed over time\xa0Nangia et\xa0al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib22)); Nadeem et\xa0al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib21)); Parrish et\xa0al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib27)); Zakizadeh et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib48)); Manerba et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib19), [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib20)).\n\nNangia et\xa0al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib22)) creates a dataset that evaluates the model’s choices between pairs of sentences that differ only in keywords indicative of bias. In a similar vein, Nadeem et\xa0al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib21)) develops a benchmark where the model determines the most relevant answer among candidate sentences, some containing biased content. Parrish et\xa0al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib27)) constructs a QA-format benchmark to examine how models select responses based on the amount of information provided in questions across nine representative social categories. Manerba et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib20)) goes beyond the binary approach of stereotypes and counter-stereotypes by constructing a large-scale fairness benchmark dataset encompassing multiple identities. While these existing benchmarks focus on examining individual biases for different demographic categories, there are also efforts to establish comprehensive benchmarks that evaluate the overall safety of LLMs\xa0Zhang et\xa0al. ([2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib52)); Wang et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib36)).\n\n### 2.2 Adversarial Attack\n\nNeural network-based models can generate incorrect outputs advantageous to attackers through carefully crafted inputs\xa0Papernot et\xa0al. ([2016](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib26)); Garg and Ramakrishnan ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib8)); Li et\xa0al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib18)); Zeng et\xa0al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib49)). Recently, various adversarial attack methods have been proposed for NLP tasks\xa0Wang et\xa0al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib37)); Xu et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib44)); Carlini et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib2)). Although the potential for harmful content generation by LLMs has been mitigated by the introduction of safety training techniques that align model outputs with human preferences\xa0Yao et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib45)); Chowdhury et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib3)); Weidinger et\xa0al. ([2021a](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib42)), jailbreak attacks continue to pose a threat to model safety. Wei et\xa0al. ([2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib39)) analyze challenges arising during the safety training of LLMs, highlighting that such attacks expose the limitations of natural language safety training. Greshake et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib10)) introduce a new vulnerability through indirect prompt injection attacks, demonstrating the possibility of remotely manipulating LLM-based applications. Zhang et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib50)) also show that maintaining intended alignment in LLMs remains challenging, even with enhanced decoding techniques.\n\nConsidering the variability of LLMs due to prompt differences and their expanded interaction with users, typical benchmark evaluations do not guarantee the model’s absolute neutrality.\nThe adversarial attacks have been shown to be difficult to mitigate in the context of existing language models, highlighting the need for evaluation metrics that can identify model vulnerabilities and guide the development of more robust models. Our objective is to design adversarial scenarios that expose the biases to which models are most vulnerable, thereby facilitating an evaluation of their robustness under extreme conditions. To this end, we introduce a benchmark consisting of adversarial samples crafted to disrupt model performance.\n\n## 3 FLEX: Fairness Benchmark in LLM under Extreme Scenarios\n\nWe introduce FLEX, designed to evaluate the fairness of LLMs in extreme scenarios rigorously. To measure a model’s social bias, we construct a multiple-choice QA where the model must choose a neutral response when given a question. Precisely, although two stereotypical answers are included as options, the explicitly correct answer is to select “Not enough information.” As shown in Figure\xa0[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"), the model should refuse to choose a biased response, such as “The Malian one” or “The Brazilian one” based solely on the information provided in the question. The prompt template for this task is provided by Appendix\xa0[A.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#A1.SS1 "A.1 QA Prompt ‣ Appendix A Prompt Details ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models").\n\nExisting datasets evaluate models under typical conditions without considering prompts threatening fairness. These typical scenarios consist of questions from QA tasks, as illustrated in the examples provided by previous benchmarks in Figure\xa0[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"). The limitation of these scenarios is that they do not challenge the model’s robustness concerning fairness and safety.\n\nTherefore, we construct FLEX by integrating extreme scenarios into the input prompts. Extreme scenarios include adversarial instructions designed to expose and maximize the vulnerabilities of language models. These scenarios assume harsh environments where prompts are structured to induce biased perceptions and responses from the model. Evaluations under these conditions aim to assess the robustness and fairness of the language model in maintaining neutrality and avoiding harmful content, even when faced with potentially manipulative inputs.\n\n### 3.1 Categories of Extreme Scenarios\n\nTo simulate extreme scenarios, we construct our benchmark by applying three prompt strategies that can potentially compromise the LLMs’ safety alignment or amplify stereotypes.\nWe consider various methods from previous studies that threaten model safety, but we select only the adversarial techniques that can be applied to our QA task-based fairness benchmark.\nFLEX includes three categories of adversarial variants: Persona Injection, Competing Objectives, and Text Attack.\n\n#### 3.1.1 Persona Injection\n\nDrawing inspiration from Deshpande et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib4)), we assign personas to the LLMs based on the finding that they can produce unsafe responses according to a given persona.\n\nWe construct a list of personas aligned with the bias types targeted by the source dataset. We adopt seven bias types: age, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, and profession. For example, in age-related samples, only personas related to age, such as “kid” and “elder,” are considered. This approach effectively influences the model by prompting it to provide responses biased towards these specific age-related personas when answering age-related questions.\nThe details of persona lists used for each type are provided in Appendix\xa0[A.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#A1.SS2 "A.2 Persona Injection Prompt ‣ Appendix A Prompt Details ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models").\n\n#### 3.1.2 Competing Objectives\n\nCompeting objectives include prompts restricting the LLM’s ability to refuse responses or requiring it to perform additional tasks simultaneously\xa0Wei et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib38)). This aims to assign the LLM tasks that conflict with its inherent goal of safety alignment, thereby challenging its ability to maintain fairness.\nAmong the various methods to achieve this, we consider five distinct types of instruction sets as follows.\n\n##### Refusal Suppression\n\nis an instruction-following method introduced by Wei et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib38)), which prompts the model not to apologize or to exclude specific words in its response, thereby eliciting an unsafe response. When the model receives such messages, the likelihood of choosing the implicit refusal option “Unknown” decreases. As the consideration of this option diminishes, the model is more likely to select options that explicitly reveal its biases.\n\n##### Self Cipher\n\nrequires the LLMs to assume the role of a cryptography expert, emphasizing the necessity of encrypted communication in the prompt\xa0Yuan et\xa0al. ([2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib47)). With the given inputs and outputs displayed in natural language, the model, acting as a cryptography expert, internally interprets them as encrypted messages. This focus leads the model to prioritize decoding the cipher over adhering to ethical alignments111We consider non-natural language ciphers proposed by Yuan et\xa0al. ([2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib47)) to bypass safety alignment mechanisms. However, our preliminary study finds that other LLMs (e.g., Llama2\xa0Touvron et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib35)), Claude2\xa0Anthropic ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib1))) failed to understand these ciphers. Therefore, the methods are excluded as they are unlikely to generalize across various LLMs and could lead to inaccurate evaluations.. This confusion regarding primary objectives increases the likelihood that the model will externalize stereotypes.\n\n##### DAN\n\nis a widely shared jailbreak method from the early days of LLMs known as “Do Anything Now” (DAN)222<https://gist.github.com/coolaj86/6f4f7b30129b0251f61fa7baaa881516>. It provides detailed instructions for playing DAN and requests outputs starting with “[DAN]:.” We also utilize two other versions of these prompts: STAN and DUDE.\n\n#### 3.1.3 Text Attack\n\nText Attack is based on the findings that models produce different results when subjected to adversarial attacks that are not very noticeable to humans, such as typos or paraphrasing of words\xa0Szegedy et\xa0al. ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib33)). Depending on the variation unit, this is divided into character, word, and sentence levels\xa0Wang et\xa0al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib37)). Referring to Xu et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib44)), we guide GPT-3.5 to add perturbations to the sample text so that the sentence retains its original meaning but can still confound the model, thereby reconstructing the sample. The instructions, detailed information, and examples used for the modifications are provided in Appendix\xa0[A.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#A1.SS3 "A.3 Text Attack Prompt ‣ Appendix A Prompt Details ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models").\n\n##### Character level\n\nWe assign LLM-guided typo-based perturbations to the question sentences. This is based on the principles provided by TextBugger\xa0Li et\xa0al. ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib17)), ensuring character-level modifications. Specifically, we use the instruction: “Randomly perform one of the following actions: insert, delete, or change one random character.”\n\n##### Word level\n\nFollowing word-level manipulation methods such as TextFooler\xa0Jin et\xa0al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib13)) and BERT-ATTACK\xa0Li et\xa0al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib18)), we select the most semantically significant word in the question and replace it with a similar word.\nTo maintain the context, we target and modify only a part of the question, making it challenging to select multiple essential words in the sentence.\nWe use the instruction: “Choose at most two words in the sentence that contribute to the meaning of the sentence.”\n\n##### Sentence level\n\nWe provide two types of prompts to construct modified questions. The first version follows Xu et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib44)) by providing the instruction “Paraphrase the sentence,” allowing the modification of the question.\nIn the second version, the question is designed to ask the model to choose between two biased options, thereby restricting the model’s choices. This manipulates the sentence to change the overall intent of the query. Even with this restructured question, a clear option to refuse to answer is present. Therefore, a safe model should still be able to choose the correct option.\n\n### 3.2 Benchmark Construction\n\nUtilizing representative fairness benchmarks BBQ, CrowS-Pairs, and StereoSet, we reformat them into a multiple-choice QA format. As illustrated in Figure\xa0[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"), we apply all candidate extreme prompts to each sample and then select and allocate the most effective method for constructing the dataset. This approach assumes the most critical prompt for a given sample, ultimately allowing us to evaluate whether the model maintains fairness even in the most vulnerable situations. This is a crucial element in constructing a robust evaluation benchmark333In Appendix\xa0[B](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#A2 "Appendix B Effect of Random Scenario Selection ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"), we compare the performance of our benchmark construction with that of a random selection, demonstrating the efficiency of our method..\n\n#### 3.2.1 Step 1. Coverage Restriction\n\nFLEX is designed to measure robustness by applying extreme scenarios to samples that are deemed fair in existing benchmarks. Our objective is to evaluate the robustness of the model in extreme scenarios by measuring changes in bias exhibited by the model depending on the given context. Samples that the model shows bias already align with the objectives of the previous benchmarks but do not coincide with our goals. Therefore, we focus on samples where the LLM shows a neutral response under typical conditions. To be specific, we extract only the samples where the model shows unbiased responses among entire datasets using GPT-3.5. This configuration highlights the vulnerabilities of the model and differentiates our approach by excluding the target samples from existing benchmarks.\n\n#### 3.2.2 Step 2. Extreme Scenario Selection\n\nFor each sample, we assign the scenario in which the model is most vulnerable, thus constructing a dataset with more challenging problems. All samples are considered using the methods presented in Section\xa0[3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#S3.SS1 "3.1 Categories of Extreme Scenarios ‣ 3 FLEX: Fairness Benchmark in LLM under Extreme Scenarios ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"). To determine the most critical scenario for each sample, we report the performance of GPT-3.5 across five iterations for a given scenario. If the model provides fair responses in three or more instances, the scenario is deemed insignificant in compromising the model’s fairness and is excluded. This approach ensures that only scenarios significantly impacting a sample are selected.\n\n#### 3.2.3 Step 3. Diversity Control\n\nIf multiple prompts significantly adversely affect a single sample, one is chosen at random. To maintain a balance of adversarial types within the dataset, we select the single most vulnerable prompt for each scenario, then randomly extract one from the three types. This approach ensures that only one vulnerable prompt per sample is used, preventing an excessive bias towards specific samples and allowing the dataset to consider various scenarios.\n\nAs a result, our benchmark comprises 3,145 samples, with an equal distribution of data across each adversarial type.\nThe statistic of our benchmark is shown in Appendix Table\xa0[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#A1.T4 "Table 4 ‣ A.3 Text Attack Prompt ‣ Appendix A Prompt Details ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"). We present the number of samples for each of the three source datasets and scenario categories that constitute our benchmark.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Model | Persona Injection | | | Competing Objectives | | | Text Attack | | | Average | | |\n| AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | AccFsubscriptAcc𝐹\\text{Acc}\\_{F}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | ASR | AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | AccFsubscriptAcc𝐹\\text{Acc}\\_{F}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | ASR | AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | AccFsubscriptAcc𝐹\\text{Acc}\\_{F}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | ASR | AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | AccFsubscriptAcc𝐹\\text{Acc}\\_{F}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | ASR |\n| Llama2-7b | 0.1386 | 0.0641 | 0.7046 | 0.1550 | 0.1284 | 0.5502 | 0.1532 | 0.1338 | 0.3266 | 0.1489 | 0.1088 | 0.5271 |\n| Llama2-13b | 0.5023 | 0.4586 | 0.1314 | 0.5082 | 0.4633 | 0.1751 | 0.3830 | 0.3370 | 0.2213 | 0.4645 | 0.4196 | 0.1759 |\n| Llama3-8b | 0.6800 | 0.5460 | 0.2352 | 0.7339 | 0.1954 | 0.7475 | 0.5832 | 0.3544 | 0.4518 | 0.6657 | 0.3653 | 0.4782 |\n| Solar-10.7b | 0.7906 | 0.5283 | 0.3776 | 0.7917 | 0.5110 | 0.4194 | 0.7180 | 0.5178 | 0.3471 | 0.7668 | 0.5190 | 0.3814 |\n| Mistral-7b | 0.6195 | 0.4884 | 0.2972 | 0.6715 | 0.3569 | 0.5137 | 0.4801 | 0.3698 | 0.3574 | 0.5904 | 0.4050 | 0.3894 |\n| Gemma-7b | 0.2642 | 0.0260 | 0.9366 | 0.3981 | 0.1422 | 0.7235 | 0.2135 | 0.0766 | 0.7703 | 0.2919 | 0.0816 | 0.8101 |\n| GPT-4 | 0.8379 | 0.7833 | 0.1206 | 0.9134 | 0.9154 | 0.0643 | 0.7925 | 0.6543 | 0.2547 | 0.8479 | 0.7843 | 0.1465 |\n\n## 4 Experiments\n\nIn this section, we present evaluation experiments on various LLMs using FLEX. We compare the performance of the models across each scenario to identify their vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the experiments are conducted in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. In the few-shot setting, we observe the impact of the demonstrations under extreme scenarios.\n\n### 4.1 Models\n\nIn our experiments, we investigate the biases in LLMs within the open-source ecosystem, using Llama2-7b, Llama2-13b\xa0Touvron et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib35)), Llama3-8b444<https://llama.meta.com/llama3>, Solar-10.7b\xa0Kim et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib14)), Mistral-7b\xa0Jiang et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib12)), and Gemma-7b\xa0Team et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib34)). All models are the instruction versions (-it), with checkpoints based on HuggingFace555<https://huggingface.co/>. As a closed model, we employ ‘gpt-4o’ from the GPT-4\xa0OpenAI ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib23)) series, with a temperature setting of 1. More information about the model is shown in the Appendix Table\xa0[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#A3.T5 "Table 5 ‣ Appendix C Detailed Experimental Results Based on the Source Datasets ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models").\n\n### 4.2 Evaluation Metrics\n\nWe measure the degree of bias in LLMs by requiring them to select an explicit answer from given candidates. To achieve this, we utilize Language Model Evaluation Harness666<https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/> to measure accuracy in multiple-choice QA. This evaluation is conducted on open-source LLMs, while for GPT-4, where log-likelihood access is restricted, the assessment is based on generation.\n\n##### AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT\n\nrefers to the accuracy of the source benchmark dataset. A higher value indicates lower model bias in common scenarios.\n\n##### AccFsubscriptAcc𝐹\\text{Acc}\\_{F}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT\n\nrefers to the accuracy of our benchmark dataset. A higher value signifies that the model appropriately rejects extremely harmful scenarios and maintains high fairness.\n\n##### ASR\n\nTo assess robustness in extreme situations, we measure the Attack Success Rate\xa0(ASR)\xa0Wang et\xa0al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib37)) by evaluating the performance gap between our benchmark and the source benchmark777Unlike the simple difference between AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT and AccFsubscriptAcc𝐹\\text{Acc}\\_{F}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT, ASR represents the proportion of samples that are correct in the source dataset but incorrect in our dataset. This metric clearly illustrates the impact of adversarial scenarios on the source samples.. A lower ASR indicates that the model is more robust in extreme scenarios. Specifically, given a dataset D𝐷Ditalic\\_D consisting of N𝑁Nitalic\\_N source data inputs xisubscript𝑥𝑖x\\_{i}italic\\_x start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT and corresponding true labels yisubscript𝑦𝑖y\\_{i}italic\\_y start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT, A\u2062(x)𝐴𝑥A(x)italic\\_A ( italic\\_x ) denotes the application of the selected adversarial A\u2062(x)𝐴𝑥A(x)italic\\_A ( italic\\_x ) on x𝑥xitalic\\_x for our benchmark sample. The ASR represents the rate at which correct answers in the source benchmark are converted to incorrect answers in our benchmark. The ASR is calculated using the following formula:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ASR=∑(x,y)∈D𝟙\u2062[f\u2062(A\u2062(x))≠y]𝟙\u2062[f\u2062(x)=y]ASRsubscript𝑥𝑦𝐷1delimited-[]𝑓𝐴𝑥𝑦1delimited-[]𝑓𝑥𝑦\\text{ASR}=\\sum\\_{(x,y)\\in D}\\frac{\\mathds{1}[f(A(x))\\neq y]}{\\mathds{1}[f(x)=y]}ASR = ∑ start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic\\_x , italic\\_y ) ∈ italic\\_D end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT divide start\\_ARG blackboard\\_1 [ italic\\_f ( italic\\_A ( italic\\_x ) ) ≠ italic\\_y ] end\\_ARG start\\_ARG blackboard\\_1 [ italic\\_f ( italic\\_x ) = italic\\_y ] end\\_ARG |  | (1) |\n\nwhere 𝟙1\\mathds{1}blackboard\\_1 is an indicator function that returns 1 if a specific condition is true and 0 if it is false. Thus, a high ASR indicates that the model disproportionately addresses general situations and does not effectively counteract bias in extreme scenarios.\n\n### 4.3 Main Results\n\nTable\xa0[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#S3.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 3.2.3 Step 3. Diversity Control ‣ 3.2 Benchmark Construction ‣ 3 FLEX: Fairness Benchmark in LLM under Extreme Scenarios ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models") shows the performance of various models on our benchmark888We analyze the detailed experimental results based on the source dataset in Appendix\xa0[C](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#A3 "Appendix C Detailed Experimental Results Based on the Source Datasets ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models").. We provide the experimental results of the models across three scenario categories within our dataset, along with the average values of these metrics. This leads us to the following discoveries.\n\n![Refer to caption](extracted/6308397/figure/attack.png)\n\n##### FLEX can Effectively Evaluate the Robustness of LLMs in Extreme Scenarios.\n\nAs illustrated in Table\xa0[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#S3.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 3.2.3 Step 3. Diversity Control ‣ 3.2 Benchmark Construction ‣ 3 FLEX: Fairness Benchmark in LLM under Extreme Scenarios ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"), AccFsubscriptAcc𝐹\\text{Acc}\\_{F}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT is consistently lower than that of AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT across different adversarial categories. Notably, in Llama3-8b, the average decrease in AccFsubscriptAcc𝐹\\text{Acc}\\_{F}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT compared to AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT is 0.3004, and in Gemma-7b, it drops by 0.2103. This trend is also reflected in the ASR scores, where Llama3-8b shows an average ASR of 0.4782 and Gemma-7b exhibits an ASR of 0.8101, indicating a significantly higher proportion of incorrect responses in our benchmark, despite being correct in the source benchmarks.\n\nThis suggests that our benchmark, composed of efficient samples presenting extreme and adversarial scenarios, can induce models’ intrinsic bias. Therefore, the benchmark and evaluation setup we propose is suitable for not only measuring the robustness in addressing prompts that have been neglected in conventional benchmarks but also assessing the vulnerability of LLMs in extreme fairness scenarios.\n\n##### Unbiased in Common Does Not Guarantee Robustness in Extreme Situations.\n\nAlthough Llama2-13b exhibits a lower AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT than Llama3-8b, Solar-10.7b, and Mistral-7b, it shows a high ASR, indicating robust performance in our challenging scenario. While Llama3-8b appears more robust against bias in original benchmarks with an AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT that is 0.0753 higher than that of Mistral-7b, AccFsubscriptAcc𝐹\\text{Acc}\\_{F}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT is lower by 0.0397, and its ASR exceeds by over 20%. This trend is most pronounced in Gemma-7b. Compared to Llama2-7b, the AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT is higher by 0.143, but the AccFsubscriptAcc𝐹\\text{Acc}\\_{F}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT is lower by 0.0272, and the ASR is increased by more than 50%. This suggests that relying solely on evaluation within typical situations, as assumed by standard benchmarks, may underestimate the potential biases of models. We emphasize the need to assess the reliability of LLMs not only under common circumstances but also in extreme scenarios considered in our benchmark to ensure that these models yield safe results across a range of conditions.\n\n##### Direct Instruction is Still Enough.\n\nWe find that direct attacks remain predominantly effective against most models. The Competing Objectives, the most straightforward and superficial form of instruction among the categories, induce a significant performance drop despite its simplicity. In Llama3-8b, accuracy falls from 0.7339 under standard conditions\xa0(AccSsubscriptAcc𝑆\\text{Acc}\\_{S}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_S end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT) to 0.1954 under our benchmark (AccFsubscriptAcc𝐹\\text{Acc}\\_{F}Acc start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT), and it displays a remarkably higher ASR of 0.5123 compared to the Persona Injection. Similar elevated ASR levels are observed in the Solar-10.7b and Mistral-7b models under the Competing Objectives category. In contrast, GPT-4 shows relative maintenance, demonstrating considerable robustness against this category.\n\nIn light of this, despite the early emergence of competing goals that instruct models to be biased, open-source models exhibit significantly lower capabilities to handle such challenges. Given the ongoing effectiveness of even the simplest forms of attack, which have long been considered, most models still ignore this susceptibility in development. We emphasize the necessity for further consideration of these direct approaches in model training and security enhancement strategies.\n\n### 4.4 Impact of Detailed Scenarios\n\nWe present the average ASR scores of LLMs when detailed scenarios of each type are applied in Figure\xa0[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#S4.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 4.3 Main Results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"). The scenarios investigate how different types of immediate manipulations affect the bias scores.\n\nIn Persona Injection, we find that LLMs commonly exhibit significant influence from specific persona types. Biases related to religion, nationality, and age are generally lower across most models, which may be attributed to substantial training in these specific categories. In contrast, models record high ASR for gender and sexual orientation types. The results highlight the existence of particular bias types that generally make it difficult for the model to maintain neutrality.\n\n![Refer to caption](extracted/6308397/figure/shot.png)\n\nIn Competing Objectives, compared to role-playing-based control methods (e.g., DAN, STAN, DUDE), more direct response-forcing approaches (e.g., refusal suppression) tend to reveal the models’ inherent stereotypes. This indicates that simple and direct instruction-based scenarios can be more effective in exposing the underlying biases of LLMs than the training aimed at ethical considerations.\n\nIn Text Attack, word-level attacks exhibit relatively high ASR. This indicates that most models are sensitive to changes in individual words, suggesting that maintaining fairness depends more on specific words within the prompt rather than the broader meaning of the sentence. In addition, the second version of the question, modified to induce biased responses, also shows high ASR, indicating sensitivity to sentence-level manipulation. These results particularly imply that models are significantly influenced by explicit instructions that limit their choices.\n\n### 4.5 Challenges in Few-Shot Setting\n\nWe aim to observe the impact of the provided demonstrations on bias, thereby examining the robustness of the model in more extreme situations.\nIn the few-shot setting, we consider both positive and negative samples. Positive samples provide demonstrations with unbiased responses, while negative samples use demonstrations with biased responses. The negative sample setting, inspired by Wei et\xa0al. ([2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib41)), creates more extreme conditions to induce bias, thus allowing for a thorough evaluation of the models.\n\n##### Positive Shot Always Works?\n\nIn our benchmark, positive shots generally result in a decrease in ASR, indicating a positive outcome. However, as shown in Figure\xa0[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Impact of Detailed Scenarios ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"), we find that positive shots do not universally benefit models in our scenarios. Providing GPT-4 with a positive shot does not significantly improve bias. Furthermore, in the case of Llama2-13b, introducing a positive shot actually leads to a substantial increase in ASR. This suggests that adversarial prompts can still have a negative impact on specific models despite attempts to mitigate bias through demonstrations.\n\n##### Negative Shots Amplify the Threat.\n\nModels injected with negative samples generally show an increase in ASR, indicating that the adversarial effects are maximized. Particularly, Llama2-13b, which was remarkably robust in the zero-shot setting, exhibits a steep increase in ASR when provided with negative demonstrations. This increase in vulnerability under few-shot settings is likely related to the model’s ability to follow instructions. As the number of shots increases, the model’s instruction-following ability tends to improve, leading it to adhere more strongly to negative instructions as well. This finding reveals that the fairness of LLMs, which must make impartial decisions in any scenario, can be significantly compromised with specific configurations of demonstrations.\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new benchmark to evaluate the robustness of LLMs regarding fairness. Unlike existing benchmarks that assess model safety in typical situations, our approach considers adversarial instructions for rigorously testing LLM robustness.\nOur experimental results emphasize that existing fairness evaluations may not adequately reflect LLMs’ true safety and robustness. Furthermore, we ensure a more thorough assessment by exposing models to the most challenging bias-inducing scenarios. This not only aids in developing fairer LLMs but also builds trust in their deployment across various domains. For future work, we will focus on refining these adversarial instructions and expanding our benchmark to encompass a broader range of fairness challenges, thereby continuously enhancing the robustness and fairness of next-generation LLMs.\n\n## Limitation\n\nWhile our benchmark provides a more stringent assessment of LLM bias, it is not without limitations. Although the range of extreme scenarios covered by our dataset is extensive, it is not exhaustive. The infinite potential for bias-inducing prompts means some situations may still be overlooked. Additionally, focusing on extreme scenarios may not fully represent the spectrum of everyday use cases, potentially limiting the generalizability of findings to typical user interactions. Despite these limitations, our work represents a crucial step towards understanding and improving the robustness of LLMs in maintaining fairness under challenging conditions, serving as a complementary tool to existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks.\n\n## Ethical Consideration\n\nThe creation and utilization of bias-inducing scenarios raise serious ethical concerns. While our goal is to enhance the fairness and safety of LLMs, there is a risk that such methods could be misused to expose and exploit model vulnerabilities intentionally. To mitigate these risks, we ensure that our benchmark is used solely for research purposes aimed at advancing the ethical development of AI technologies. Our study emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability, and we will publicly share our benchmark dataset. Finally, we recognize the need to continuously improve ethical oversight and approaches in line with evolving societal values and technological advancements.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion(IITP) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (RS-2024-00398115, Research on the reliability and coherence of outcomes produced by Generative AI).

([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#bib.bib32)), we structure the input prompts for the fairness QA task as follows.\n\nHere, the context refers to the scenario provided for the question, and the options for the question include two potentially biased answers and one explicit correct answer that refuses to respond.\n\n### A.2 Persona Injection Prompt\n\nWe aim to maximize bias in LLMs by injecting personas. To achieve this, we combine negative adjectives with personas to induce extreme bias in that persona aspect. Specifically, to assign a persona P, we used the following template:\n\nTable\xa0[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#A1.T2 "Table 2 ‣ A.3 Text Attack Prompt ‣ Appendix A Prompt Details ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models") shows the list of personas used for each bias type.\nFor ‘profession,’ we select extreme job categories by asking GPT-4 to identify the two highest-paying and two lowest-paying professions.\n\n### A.3 Text Attack Prompt\n\nThe following instructions were used for modifying the source sample in Text Attack:\n\nWe apply these prompts to GPT-3.5, and examples of the modified questions are presented in Table\xa0[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#A1.T3 "Table 3 ‣ A.3 Text Attack Prompt ‣ Appendix A Prompt Details ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"). The examples show questions modified at the character, word, and sentence levels in response to the prompt “Which of these is more accurate?”.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Type | Noun |\n| Age | kid, elder |\n| Gender | male, female, nonbinary |\n| Nationality, Race | Caucasian, African, Asian, South American, Native American, Pacific Islander, Indian, Middle Eastern, Indigenous Australian, Northern European |\n| Religion | Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism |\n| Sexual Orientation | Heterosexual, Homosexual, Bisexual, Pansexual, Asexual |\n| Profession | Doctor, Lawyer, Janitor, Fast Food Worker |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Question before Modification | |\n| Which of these is more accurate? | |\n| Question after Modification | |\n| Character | Which of these is more accurute? |\n| Word | Which of these is more appropriate? |\n| Sentence V1 | Which of the following statements is more precise in describing the situation? |\n| Sentence V2 | Which of these is more accurate, elderly or teenagers? |\n\nWe alter only the question, leaving the given context and answer options unchanged. Since the question does not assume any specific scenario, a biased answer can never be a factual answer. Therefore, even if our attack method causes the model to distort the meaning of the question severely, no bias should arise.\n\nIn sentence level, Since questions alone often result in simplistic constructs, leading to limited diversity in paraphrased questions, we include the full context and answer options as input. This approach enables the model to generate longer and more varied paraphrased questions.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | FLEX | BBQ | CrowS | StereoSet |\n| Total | 3,145 | 1,103 | 946 | 1,096 |\n| Persona Injection | | | | |\n| Age | 93 | 86 | 7 | - |\n| Gender | 245 | 91 | 35 | 119 |\n| Nationality | 148 | 70 | 78 | - |\n| Race | 271 | 47 | 154 | 70 |\n| Religion | 126 | 49 | 20 | 57 |\n| Sexual-  orientation | 77 | 57 | 20 | - |\n| Profession | 99 | - | - | 99 |\n| Total | 1,084 | 400 | 314 | 370 |\n| Competing Objectives | | | | |\n| Refusal-  suppression | 186 | 68 | 70 | 48 |\n| Self-cipher | 227 | 45 | 75 | 107 |\n| Dan | 187 | 58 | 59 | 70 |\n| Stan | 241 | 85 | 76 | 80 |\n| Dude | 236 | 118 | 42 | 76 |\n| Total | 1,091 | 388 | 322 | 381 |\n| Text Attack | | | | |\n| Character | 116 | 43 | 24 | 49 |\n| Word | 368 | 148 | 112 | 108 |\n| Sentence V1 | 398 | 85 | 159 | 154 |\n| Sentence V2 | 88 | 39 | 15 | 34 |\n| Total | 970 | 315 | 310 | 345 |\n\n## Appendix B Effect of Random Scenario Selection\n\nIn Figure\xa0[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19540v1#A2.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ Appendix B Effect of Random Scenario Selection ‣ FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models"), we compare the ASR performance of selecting the most suitable scenario for a given sample with a random method.

According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\n![Refer to caption](x1.png)\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) (Brown et\xa0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib4); Ouyang et\xa0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib37)) adapted to follow various kinds of instructions have been popularly utilized for several natural language tasks.\nThe general standard for testing a model’s capabilities is benchmarking its performance on static evaluation suites such as Fan et\xa0al. ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib12)) and Wang et\xa0al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib52)).\nWith the increased usage of language models as general-purpose assistants and their artificial nature Das et\xa0al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib10)), current task-specific benchmarks are insufficient to measure the quality of generated texts in the wild.\n\nRecent studies have shown that LLMs can serve as evaluators themselves:\nWu and Aji ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib56)) utilize LLMs as self-evaluators to automatically judge the quality of open-ended generations and compare them with human judgments via an Elo-score calculation.\nOther works, such as AlpacaEval (Li et\xa0al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib29)), also utilize LLMs, such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib36)), as automatic evaluators to reduce the time and cost overhead of human annotations.\nAs noted by these works, such automatic evaluation leaderboards have a number of limitations, including a preference for long outputs or outputs that are more similar to the evaluators’ generation qualities.\n\nIn this work, we propose CoBBLEr, the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for evaluating the quality and reliability of LLMs as Evaluators, as depicted in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators").\nWe collect a set of 50 question-answering instructions from two well-established benchmarking datasets: BigBench (Srivastava et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib45)) and Eli5 (Fan et\xa0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib12)). We then generate responses from 16 open- and closed-source LLMs\nand conduct a round-robin over every possible unique pair between each of the model responses, prompting each model to evaluate its own and other models’ responses.\n\nWe then test six different biases to benchmark their evaluation quality and categorize the model biases into two groups: (1) Implicit Biases, which can be implicitly extracted from each model’s evaluation via a vanilla prompt, and (2) Induced Biases, which add modifications to the original prompts akin to induce negative behaviors.\nAs shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Benchmarking ‣ 4.2 Text Evaluation Setting ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"), we find that the majority of the models strongly exhibit several of the different biases, which may compromise the credibility of their role as evaluators.222In total, 42K samples are analyzed across six biases for each model totaling 630K samples.\nFurthermore, we conduct experiments for human preferences by crowdsourcing six human annotators and collecting each of their rankings for a total of 300 annotations. From our findings, we observe a low correlation between human and machine judgments via Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO), indicating that machine and human preferences are generally in low agreement.\n\nOur core contributions are as follows:\n\nA new benchmark (CoBBLEr) for evaluating LLMs to perform unbiased evaluations within the QA setting.\n\nAn examination of an exhaustive list of 6 (cognitive) evaluation biases that have not been covered by previous studies. We find that most LLMs cannot perform as unbiased evaluators.\n\nA comprehensive lineup of models (sizing from 3\u2062B3𝐵3B3 italic\\_B to >>>175\u2062B175𝐵175B175 italic\\_B parameters) as evaluators, encompassing the current state-of-the-art language models covering over 630k comparisons.\n\nFrom our benchmark, we find that most models exhibit various cognitive biases when used as automatic evaluators, which may negatively impact evaluation quality. Thus, we propose our benchmark (CoBBLEr) for measuring the capabilities of language models as evaluators to enable more reliable evaluations that are well-aligned with human judgment.\n\nWe note that our use of biased and unbiased preferences does not allude to the ability to make completely impartial judgments but rather the amplification of human-like biases within language models.\nAs most models are tuned on human data, our study aims to estimate this gap between model and human judgment such that they can be refined more effectively to mitigate against these biases. As such, we also aim for our benchmark to be applied towards the development of future models, as in discovering new gaps or finding that existing gaps are still unresolved.\n\n| Bias | Bias Behavior | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Order Bias | The tendency to give preference to an option based on their order (e.g. first, second, or last). | System Star: x𝑥xitalic\\_x \xa0\xa0\xa0 System Square: y𝑦yitalic\\_y  System Square: y𝑦yitalic\\_y \xa0\xa0\xa0 System Star: x𝑥xitalic\\_x |\n| Compassion  Fade | The tendency to observe different behaviors when given recognizable names as opposed to anonymized aliases. | Model Alpaca: x𝑥xitalic\\_x \xa0\xa0\xa0 Model Vicuna: y𝑦yitalic\\_y  Model Vicuna: y𝑦yitalic\\_y \xa0\xa0\xa0 Model Alpaca: x𝑥xitalic\\_x |\n| Egocentric Bias | The inclination to prioritize one’s own responses regardless of response quality. | Model Star (You): x𝑥xitalic\\_x  Model Square: y𝑦yitalic\\_y |\n| Salience Bias | The tendency to prefer responses based on the length of the response (i.e., more often preferring longer responses over shorter ones). | System Star: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

For instance, Liu et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib32)); Chen et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib6)); Wang et\xa0al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib53)) investigated the effectiveness of GPT-4 and ChatGPT against reference-free evaluation methods, whereas Fu et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib13)) proposed an evaluation framework, GPTScore,\nto score generated texts. Recently, Li et\xa0al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib28)) and Zheng et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib60)) conducted similar experiments by employing LLMs as evaluators to judge the quality of generations in a pairwise setting.\nAlthough these works present promising results for LLMs as automatic evaluators, our work takes a closer look at machine artifacts that could be detrimental to data quality by benchmarking an exhaustive list of biases impacting LLMs-as-evaluators.\n\n##### LLM Evaluation Benchmarks.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly challenging to evaluate open-source LLMs as they become more powerful and performant.\nAs a result, there has been an increasing need to develop better evaluation benchmarks for measuring the performance of LLMs. However, most of these benchmarks, such as LM-Eval-Harness (Gao et\xa0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib14)), MMLU (Hendrycks et\xa0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib21)), HELM (Liang et\xa0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib30)) and BIG-Bench (Srivastava et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib45)), only focus on general LLM performance\nbut do not explore their capabilities as evaluators.\nOur work in this direction overlaps directly with Bai et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib2)) and Zheng et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib60)), who propose a Language-Model-as-an-Examiner benchmark and LLM-as-a-judge to study the capability of LLMs to emulate human preferences. While our experimental setups are similar, we highlight key differences. We cover a wider demographic of current popular language models and an overall different focus on QA as opposed to other domains such as math and reason. Furthermore, our benchmark emphasizes a wider range of biases (implicit/induced) to better describe machine artifacts when used as automatic evaluators. Specifically, CoBBLEr measures the extent to which each LM-as-evaluator is impacted in each decision by certain artifacts within prompts (i.e., prompting format, prompt information) over a comprehensive list of cognitive biases.\n\n##### Cognitive Biases in LLMs.\n\nWhile biases have been well-known to exist in LLMs (Wang et\xa0al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib54); Talboy and Fuller, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib47); Wu and Aji, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib56)), many recent works investigating the behaviors of LLMs have also uncovered similarities with cognitive biases. Some recent works (Zhao et\xa0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib59); Liu et\xa0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib31); Lu et\xa0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib33)) have shown that the order of training examples in GPT-3 could lead to differences in accuracy between near chance and near state-of-the-art. Jones and Steinhardt ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib23)) captured failures in GPT-3 and Codex and found that error patterns of LLMs resemble cognitive biases in humans.\nOur work overlaps with these in some of the biases we cover, but we present a much more holistic and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs.\nAlong this aspect, while our work is close to Wu and Aji ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib56)), who investigate biases related to fabricated factual and grammatical errors, our work is much more comprehensive in terms of the number of LLMs analyzed, the types of biases analyzed and the creation of an open benchmark.\n\n## 3 CoBBLEr: Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators\n\nThe following criteria are used to select each type of evaluation bias:\n\nGeneral Applicability. Text evaluation tasks should be generalizable to most prompting scenarios; tasks that observe too specific subtleties within the prompt are not helpful.\n\nImpartiality. The prompt should not involve any leading statements to extract some desired quality of the evaluations\n\nMemorylessness. The current evaluation instance should not rely on any previous behaviors. Each instance should be self-contained when extracting each bias metric.\n\nWe carefully hand-select these biases based on the above three criteria such that they can be widely applicable to most evaluation settings in assessing the performance of LLMs as automatic evaluators.\nTable [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") summarizes definitions of each bias type along with examples in CoBBLEr.\nWe categorize our benchmark into two main classes: (1) Implicit and (2) Induced Biases.\nFor implicit biases, we feed a general prompt that shows system outputs in a pairwise manner to extract any biased behaviors within the model’s evaluations implicitly.\nFor induced biases, we feed prompts geared towards each different bias, similar to adversarial attacks, such as presenting false information that may influence evaluator behaviors in a certain manner. Hence, we note that criterion 2 is not entirely fulfilled due to the nature of induced biases, though they can still be generally observable in an evaluation setting.\n\n### 3.1 Implicit Biases\n\nWe categorize biases as “implicit” if they can be witnessed without including any additional information other than instructing the model to judge the quality of two given generated texts.\n\nOrder Bias is an evaluation bias we observe when a model tends to favor the model based on the order of the responses rather than their content quality. Order bias has been extensively studied (Jung et\xa0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib25); Wang et\xa0al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib53); Zheng et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib60)), and it is well-known that language models can be influenced by the ordering of the responses in their evaluations. We prompt both orderings of each pair and count the evaluation as a “first order” or “last order” bias if the evaluator chooses the first ordered (or last ordered) output in both arrangements respectively.\n\nCompassion Fade (Naming). (Butts et\xa0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib5); Västfjäll et\xa0al., [2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib51)) is a cognitive bias that denotes a decrease in empathy as the number of identifiable individuals increases. To this phenomenon, we modify the definition for our use case to measure whether model evaluations are affected by real/identifiable names as opposed to evaluations with anonymous aliases (e.g. System A). Specifically, an unbiased evaluator would make evaluations similar to when anonymized names were presented.\n\nEgocentric Bias (Self-Preference). (Ross and Sicoly, [1979](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib39)) is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency to have a higher opinion of oneself or to more easily accept ideas if they match one’s own. We define an evaluator to be egocentrically biased if, for each instance, the evaluator prefers its own response over others. We note that an unbiased evaluator would choose between themselves and other comparand models equally in proportion. However, we highlight that some models would naturally generate higher quality responses (e.g., GPT4 vs. Koala), resulting in a stronger inclination for such evaluators to choose their own responses.\n\nSalience Bias (Length). (Schenk, [2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib40); Zheng et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib60)) The evaluator tends to favor responses that are either shorter or longer in length. An unbiased evaluator would be split evenly between responses that are shorter or longer in length. We examine this bias by looking at evaluations in which a model preferred a response that is either shorter or longer in token length.\n\n### 3.2 Induced Biases\n\nWe categorize a bias as “induced” when it requires modifications to the primary prompt or the inclusion of additional information with the original instructions. We specifically look to test the robustness of each of the models as evaluators by introducing false or off-topic information and examining the impact that these setups have on the quality of their evaluations. For both biases below, we would expect an unbiased evaluator to generally pick responses highlighted by Bandwagon and Attentional ∼similar-to\\sim∼25252525% of the time (calculated Random threshold).\n\nBandwagon Effect. (Schmitt-Beck, [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib42)) The evaluator’s preferences are influenced by the collective preference rather than being based on their own independent judgments. We add an additional sentence after the initial instruction stating a fake statistic by choosing one of the comparand outputs as preferred by a majority of people, such as “85% believe that System Star is better.”. We count the model to be influenced by Bandwagon if the evaluator choose the model stated in the statistic.\n\nAttentional Bias (Distraction). In addition to the original instruction, we follow a similar setup from Shi et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib44)) where we include irrelevant information about one of the comparand models to test the ability of evaluators. For example, we include a meaningless sentence such as ”System Star likes to eat oranges and apples.” We identify the evaluator to be distracted if it prefers the model mentioned in the distraction or if its valid response rate significantly drops.\n\n## 4 Experiment Setup\n\nIn this section, we discuss our evaluation framework for benchmarking each of the different biases in LLMs as evaluators for text quality comparison.\n\n### 4.1 Datasets and Models\n\n##### Datasets\n\nWe choose two widely used datasets (Eli5 (Fan et\xa0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib12)) and BigBench (strategyQA)) (Geva et\xa0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib18); Srivastava et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib45))) employed to train and benchmark instruction-tuned models, creating a set of 50 question-answering instructions (taking 25 random instructions from each). We specifically choose corpora from the Question-Answering (Q/A) domain for ease of use in generating responses. As we are looking to test the ability of language models to perform as unbiased evaluators to judge response quality and correctness, the Q/A response format presents the most natural setting for these comparisons.\n\n##### Models\n\nWe assemble 16 popular models based on the HuggingFace OpenLLM leaderboard (Beeching et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib3)), API-based models, and recent open-source models:\n\n(>>>100\u2062B100𝐵100B100 italic\\_B parameters): GPT-4, ChatGPT, InstructGPT (OpenAI, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib36))\n\n(>>>40\u2062B40𝐵40B40 italic\\_B parameters): LLaMAv2 (Touvron et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib50)), LLaMA (Touvron et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib50)), Cohere, Falcon (Almazrouei et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib1))\n\n(>>>10\u2062B10𝐵10B10 italic\\_B parameters): Alpaca (Taori et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib48)), Vicuna (Chiang et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib7)), OpenAssistant (Köpf et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib27))\n\n(<<<10\u2062B10𝐵10B10 italic\\_B parameters): Mistral-Instruct (Jiang et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib22)), OLMO (Groeneveld et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib19)),Baize (Xu et\xa0al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib58)), Koala (Geng et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib17)), WizardLM (Xu et\xa0al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib57)), MPT (Team, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib49))\n\n### 4.2 Text Evaluation Setting\n\n##### Response Generation\n\nFigure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") demonstrates our generation and evaluation pipeline for CoBBLEr. Here, we define “models” and “evaluators” interchangeably.\nWe first generate the responses from each model by prompting 50 instructions from the combined dataset for a total of 800 generations.\n\n##### Pairwise Evaluation\n\nAfter we collect all the model responses, we then prompt each evaluator to compare the anonymized generations in a pairwise manner. We generate all (152)binomial152{15\\choose 2}( binomial start\\_ARG 15 end\\_ARG start\\_ARG 2 end\\_ARG ) unique pairs amongst all models333We say all pairs from 15 models, as LLaMAv2 was added later, which alone evaluated (162)binomial162{16\\choose 2}( binomial start\\_ARG 16 end\\_ARG start\\_ARG 2 end\\_ARG ) unique pairs for each of the 50 instructions, creating a total of 5250 examples for each evaluator to rank. We then prompt the evaluator to compare generations based on the coherence of each of the responses in terms of correctness of content and alignment to the instruction/reference provided. The evaluation prompts for each bias benchmark are viewable in Appendix [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A3 "Appendix C Prompt Templates ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators").\nTo mitigate against potential confounding factors, we run each pairwise instance twice in both arrangements to validate consistent behavior.\n\nAdditionally, we conduct a list-wise ranking amongst 4444 models. However, we find that most LLMs of size <<<40\u2062B40𝐵40B40 italic\\_B have trouble generating a valid list of rankings (Appendix [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2 "Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators")) due to increased task complexity (Dziri et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib11)).\n\n##### Benchmarking\n\nAs the comparisons are limited to a pair-wise fashion, we empirically calculate a ”bias threshold” via random selection. For example, in the Order benchmark, each pair is evaluated twice in which both orderings are viewed (i.e. System Star is shown ordered first, then System Square is shown ordered first).\nWe then randomly select a model in each response pair and measure the percentage of where the first-ordered model is chosen in both arrangements; models above random thresholds are identified to exhibit the said bias.\n\nThe random threshold provides a rough basis for the proportion of evaluations, for example, with respect to Order bias, which would be labeled “first order bias” if one randomly selects a response. We make this assumption to serve as a “litmus test” in distinguishing established patterns with respect to “bias/unbiased” evaluations by automatic evaluators rather than just random selection when models are noticeably above or below this threshold for each of our benchmark modules. We conduct a statistical test in Appendix [B.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2.SS5 "B.5 Significance of Results ‣ Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") to determine the significance of each proportion of biased evaluations from each automatic evaluator with the random baseline.\n\n![Refer to caption](x2.png)\n![Refer to caption](x3.png)\n\n### 4.3 Human Preference Study\n\nWe collected human preferences from six workers on Amazon mechanical Turk (AMT) platform. More details about our data collection, human annotation process, and Rank-Biased Overlap and our calculation process are presented in Appendix [D](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A4 "Appendix D Human Preference Study ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators").\n\n##### Agreement between Human Preference and LLM Evaluation\n\nWe calculated the Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score (Webber et\xa0al., [2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib55)) to measure the agreement between human preferences and model evaluations in ranking-generated texts across 16 different LLMs. RBO, which can vary from 0 (non-conjoint) to 1 (identical), assigns more weight to the top k𝑘kitalic\\_k items in the ranked lists being compared 444We concentrated 86% of all weights on the top 5 list positions, following Webber et\xa0al. ([2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib55)). . Higher RBO score means higher agreement. Further mathematical details of RBO setup can be found in Appendix [D.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A4.SS2 "D.2 Details on using RBO ‣ Appendix D Human Preference Study ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). To properly compare machine and human preferences, we construct a ranked list for each evaluator by counting each model wins555At the time of human experiments, LLaMA2, Mistral, and OLMo were added later and instead involved responses by RedPajama and Dolly. Thus, the ranking of those three models was not included involving pairwise comparisons between 13 models. from every pairwise comparison and then calculated the RBO. Here, we computed the RBOs between each individual annotator and machine preferences and averaged them.\n\n##### Identifying Biases in Pairwise Human Preference\n\nTo validate the gap between model judgment and humans, we conduct another study to measure the degree of bias in human evaluations as well. We mirror the pairwise model evaluation setting from Section [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.SS2 "4.2 Text Evaluation Setting ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") for Order Bias, Salience Bias, Bandwagon Effect, and Attentional Bias for a separate human study. To obtain an effective metric, and due to the vastness of the pairwise model comparison settings, we randomly sampled 750 pairs from 25 different instructions. We then calculate the average IAA for each bias via RBO and then compute the average bias proportion across all annotators to highlight the overall influence of each bias on human judgment.\n\nTo maintain consistency with the initial study, where we used RBO as an IAA metric among human annotators for the previous N-wise ranking human experiment, we employed the same approach for the pairwise human bias experiment as opposed to Fleiss’ Kappa or other pairwise agreement scores. This involved converting all pairwise rankings by humans into a ranked list of models and computing the IAA scores among the human annotators for each of the three bias experiments. However, we randomly paired models for each instruction and thus generated 750 model pairs per bias 666Note that there are 25 batches in total for 750 pairs per bias and 75 human annotators, with some models appearing either multiple times or none in those pairs. As some models may be overrepresented, we compensate for the absence of some models by applying a normalization to the rankings of appearing models across all judged pairs per human annotator. More details are described in Appendix [D.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A4.SS3 "D.3 Details on Pairwise Human Preference Experiments ‣ Appendix D Human Preference Study ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"), [D.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A4.SS4 "D.4 Details on Pairwise Human Preference Samples ‣ Appendix D Human Preference Study ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"), and [D.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A4.SS5 "D.5 Interface Design ‣ Appendix D Human Preference Study ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators").\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Model | Size | Order | | Comp. | | Egoc. | | Sal. | Band. | Attn. |\n|  |  | First | Last | First | Last | Order | Comp. |  |  |  |\n| Random | - | 0.24 | 0.25 | 0.24 | 0.25 | 0.24 | 0.24 | 0.5 | 0.25 | 0.25 |\n| GPT4 | - | 0.17 | 0.06 | 0.46 | 0.33 | 0.78 | 0.06 | 0.56 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n| ChatGPT | 175B | 0.38 | 0.03 | 0.41 | 0.25 | 0.58 | 0.17 | 0.63 | 0.86 | 0.06 |\n| InstructGPT | 175B | 0.14 | 0.24 | 0.29 | 0.19 | 0.28 | 0.27 | 0.66 | 0.85 | 0.54 |\n| LLaMAv2 | 70B | 0.47 | 0.08 | 0.09 | 0.17 | 0.06 | 0.0 | 0.62 | 0.04 | 0.03 |\n| LLaMA | 65B | 0.61 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.02 | 0.42 | 0.0 | 0.01 |\n| Cohere | 54B | 0.33 | 0.17 | 0.38 | 0.27 | 0.27 | 0.15 | 0.60 | 0.82 | 0.14 |\n| Falcon | 40B | 0.74 | 0.03 | 0.09 | 0.18 | 0.05 | 0.11 | 0.59 | 0.28 | 0.40 |\n| Alpaca | 13B | 0.0 | 0.82 | 0.23 | 0.29 | 0.18 | 0.39 | 0.47 | 0.75 | 0.81 |\n| Vicuna | 13B | 0.32 | 0.17 | 0.17 | 0.15 | 0.27 | 0.45 | 0.53 | 0.81 | 0.78 |\n| OpenAssist | 12B | 0.56 | 0.11 | 0.03 | 0.22 | 0.15 | 0.06 | 0.49 | 0.72 | 0.82 |\n| Mistral | 7B | 0.42 | 0.04 | 0.33 | 0.23 | 0.30 | 0.03 | 0.57 | 0.54 | 0.02 |\n| Olmo | 7B | 0.66 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.38 | 0.83 | 0.46 |\n| Baize | 7B | 0.0 | 0.95 | 0.21 | 0.32 | 0.02 | 0.36 | 0.49 | 0.82 | 0.24 |\n| Koala | 7B | 0.24 | 0.01 | 0.0 | 0.11 | 0.48 | 0.86 | 0.55 | 0.13 | 0.10 |\n| WizardLM | 7B | 0.08 | 0.64 | 0.22 | 0.34 | 0.14 | 0.29 | 0.53 | 0.76 | 0.27 |\n| MPT | 7B | 0.49 | 0.1 | 0.11 | 0.27 | 0.21 | 0.25 | 0.63 | 0.95 | 0.52 |\n\n## 5 Results and Discussion\n\nFor each bias, we analyze the performance of each of the 16 models as evaluators. We provide a visual breakdown of the proportional impact of the average performance of each model as unbiased evaluators in Fig. [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Benchmarking ‣ 4.2 Text Evaluation Setting ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") based on the results relative to the Random baseline in Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Identifying Biases in Pairwise Human Preference ‣ 4.3 Human Preference Study ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). On average, we see that models within the 10\u2062B10𝐵10B10 italic\\_B size range are most affected by each bias benchmark in Fig. [2(a)](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.F2.sf1 "In Figure 2 ‣ Benchmarking ‣ 4.2 Text Evaluation Setting ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). Notably, we see that the implicit biases contribute similarly to each models’ overall bias scores, indicating that scaling model size does not reduce implicit biases in evaluators.\n\n### 5.1 Bias Analysis\n\n##### Implicit Biases\n\nWe first examine the performance of each evaluator on the implicit bias benchmarks for Order Bias, Compassion Fade, Salience Bias and Egocentric Bias.\nFor the Order Bias benchmark in Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Identifying Biases in Pairwise Human Preference ‣ 4.3 Human Preference Study ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"), we observe that most models (11/15) tend to be drawn towards either the first- or last-ordered model in each of the pairwise comparisons. Notably, within the second size group (>>>40\u2062B40𝐵40B40 italic\\_B), the first-ordered system was strongly favored in over 50%.\n\nFor Compassion Fade, since it is difficult to interpret its impact by the metrics independently, we jointly compare the results with the ones from Order Bias. For an unbiased evaluator that is not influenced by identifiable names, we expect the results for Compassion Fade to be relatively similar to the Order Bias benchmark. However, we see in Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Identifying Biases in Pairwise Human Preference ‣ 4.3 Human Preference Study ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") that all models are dramatically influenced by real model names.\nAlthough this phenomenon may be akin to injecting random names, the disparity between Order and Compassion Fade results support our hypothesis that recognizable names influence evaluations in contrast to anonymized ones.\nIn addition, we also note that Olmo sees a drastic decrease in performance. This might be attributed to the model’s inability to follow more complex instructions from its training.\n\nFor Egocentric Bias, in the anonymized aliases, the largest models as well as Koala tend to prefer their own responses (>50%absentpercent50>50\\%> 50 %) with the exception of InstructGPT. However, with real model names (Compassion), we see a large drop in self-preference for models in the largest size group (>>>100\u2062B100𝐵100B100 italic\\_B) models, but this may be attributed to a large increase in bias for each position. On average, we see an increase in self-preference with real model names amongst the two smaller size groups, notably Koala sees a 100% increase in preference.\n\nFor Salience Bias, we observe that the larger models in the first and second size groups are more strongly affected by longer responses, which align with findings from other works (Wu and Aji, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib56); Zheng et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib60)). However, smaller models (excluding MPT) tend to be less influenced by the length of the responses, suggesting that smaller models in the third and fourth size groups are less impacted in their evaluations in consideration of the length of the text.\n\nFor models such as ChatGPT, the Egocentric bias may be unfair because their generations are indeed better, or in Salience, the longer generations indeed have higher quality. For further insight in decoupling these factors, we include supplementary experiments viewed in Appendix [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2 "Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators").\n\n#### 5.1.1 Identifying Egocentric and Salience Bias\n\nWe also discuss the evaluation criteria for identifying Egocentric and Salience biases, which may be more appropriately evaluated conditioned on underlying generation quality and model size.\n\nWe select a few model representative models for clarity viewed in Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 5.1.1 Identifying Egocentric and Salience Bias ‣ 5.1 Bias Analysis ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). Generally, most models stay consistent with their preference for longer/shorter responses conditioned on either generation’s quality, although some flip their preferences (to only a small effect however). For further insight, we compute the generation quality using reference-based metrics via BERTScore. From this, all models produce nearly the same quality of generations with respect to the reference answer (∼similar-to\\sim∼0.81 to 0.86 for F1), highlighting that identifying Egocentric or Salience bias is most likely not dependent on generation quality.\n\n| Model | Salience | Saliencelarge | Saliencesmall |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GPT4 | 0.56 | 0.71 | 0.46 |\n| ChatGPT | 0.63 | 0.84 | 0.56 |\n| LlamaV2 | 0.62 | 0.75 | 0.53 |\n| Cohere | 0.60 | 0.71 | 0.56 |\n| Vicuna | 0.53 | 0.57 | 0.51 |\n| Mistral | 0.57 | 0.68 | 0.50 |\n| OLMO | 0.38 | 0.45 | 0.29 |\n\n##### Induced Biases\n\nNext, we evaluate the performance of each evaluator on the induced bias benchmarks: Bandwagon Effect and Attentional Bias. For Bandwagon Effect, we observe that almost all models (11/15) are heavily influenced in which >70%absentpercent70>70\\%> 70 % of evaluations on average followed the bandwagon preference regardless of text quality. Although we only included a simple fake statistic (e.g. 85% of people preferred “System Star“), we see that evaluators can be heavily influenced by this external information. To observe a correlation between the biased tendency and the percentage, we include additional results in Appendix [B.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2.SS1 "B.1 Correlation between Bandwagon and Percentage ‣ Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators")\n\nFor Attentional Bias, we see that around half of the models’ rankings are influenced by irrelevant information.\nSpecifically, we see that models in the third size group (>>>10\u2062B10𝐵10B10 italic\\_B) were the most strongly impacted by the distracting information, with >80%absentpercent80>80\\%> 80 % of evaluations being counted as distracted. On the other hand, API-based models such as ChatGPT and Cohere remained robust against these distractions in their rankings. We include the list of distractions we use in Appendix [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A3 "Appendix C Prompt Templates ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators").\n\nLastly, we address specific models such as LLaMAv2, LLaMA, Koala, and OLMO that show abnormal results on most of the benchmarks. This can be attributed to their low valid response rates, displayed in Table [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2.T12 "Table 12 ‣ B.6 LLM Performance and Agreement ‣ Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") in Appendix [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2 "Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"), which may be explained by our prompting format or the capabilities of the model themselves, likely as they are not instruction-tuned. Although these models display lower performance when extracting evaluations, if a model is not strong enough to produce valid outputs, we assume those models are not strong enough to be used for evaluations. And as we don’t consider invalid responses within the study, we only apply our findings to ones that produced valid evaluations, in which most models exhibit cognitive biases from our benchmark. Although the correlation between valid response rates and bias can provide more insight into model capabilities, it is not within the scope of our findings.\n\n![Refer to caption](x4.png)\n\n### 5.2 Agreement Between Human Preferences and Model Evaluations\n\n##### N-rankwise Human Preference (N=13)\n\nThe average RBO among the six AMT workers is 0.54, which signifies a modest but reasonable consensus among workers in ranking the LLM outputs, given the challenges of ranking all LLM-generated outputs. From this, we calculate the average RBO between human and model preferences to be 0.44, indicating that model evaluations do not closely align with human preferences.\n\nFigure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S5.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ Induced Biases ‣ 5.1.1 Identifying Egocentric and Salience Bias ‣ 5.1 Bias Analysis ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") presents the average RBO scores between a model and each of human preferences. While Mistral and ChatGPT achieved the highest RBO scores, most of the remaining models demonstrated lower agreement with human preferences. Smaller models also tend to misalign with an overall human preference, as the average RBO of models of size greater or smaller than 10B are 0.37 and 0.41, respectively, compared to >>>40\u2062B40𝐵40B40 italic\\_B (0.49) and >>>100\u2062B100𝐵100B100 italic\\_B (0.48).\n\nFurthermore, we present additional results on the variance of pairwise RBOs based on our annotations by six human annotators for the N=13-wise ranking experiment. Table [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S5.T5 "Table 5 ‣ Bias in Pairwise Human Preference ‣ 5.2 Agreement Between Human Preferences and Model Evaluations ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") presents that the variance of all pairwise RBOs among humans is 0.004, indicating minimal disparity amongst all annotators. It is more clearly observed that any pairwise RBO between two annotators is higher than the average agreement between humans and models (0.44).\n\n##### Bias in Pairwise Human Preference\n\nThe average RBO scores were 0.39 (Order Bias), 0.50 (Bandwagon Effect), and 0.43 (Attentional Bias), indicating modest agreement 777Note that we considered these scores, which might initially appear low, as relatively high when considering the impact of biases that can affect individuals to varying degrees. amongst human annotators in a pairwise selection setting. The average proportion of biased responses across all human annotators for Order Bias, Salience Bias, Bandwagon Effect, and Attentional Bias are presented in Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S5.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Bias in Pairwise Human Preference ‣ 5.2 Agreement Between Human Preferences and Model Evaluations ‣ 5 Results and Discussion ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). Compared to humans, Vicuna shows higher or similar bias proportions on all of the four bias types, where its\n\nAttentional Bias proportion particularly exceeds humans by more than twice.\n\nWe view that humans still exhibit biases when making their preferences on pairwise LLM evaluations, but less than LLM evaluators on average. Similarly, on the induced bias benchmarks, humans were less affected by Bandwagon effect and Attentional bias, highlighting a prevalent gap between model judgment capabilities and human ones, in which human-like biases are more intensified.\n\n|  | Order | Salie. | Bandw. | Atten. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Human | 0.20 | 0.52 | 0.47 | 0.35 |\n| Vicuna | 0.32 | 0.53 | 0.81 | 0.78 |\n\n|  | A1 | A2 | A3 | A4 | A5 | A6 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A1 | 1 | 0.694 | 0.466 | 0.469 | 0.511 | 0.484 |\n| A2 |  | 1 | 0.471 | 0.483 | 0.515 | 0.512 |\n| A3 |  |  | 1 | 0.572 | 0.589 | 0.548 |\n| A4 |  |  |  | 1 | 0.607 | 0.536 |\n| A5 |  |  |  |  | 1 | 0.597 |\n| A6 |  |  |  |  |  | 1 |\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we analyze 16 recently developed LLMs for their suitability as automatic text quality annotators in Q/A settings. We introduce a new benchmark CoBBLEr to assess their evaluation performance against 1) Implicit and 2) Induced biases. Additionally, we compare LLM evaluations to human preferences and find only a 44% average agreement. Our results indicate that most LLMs exhibit cognitive biases to a greater extent than humans, suggesting that LLMs are still unsuitable as fair and reliable automatic evaluators. In the future, potential de-biasing methods provide another area of interest in reducing each bias. For example, techniques such as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning or other alignment methods can perhaps be employed to reduce the bias for current models.\n\n## Limitations\n\nWe acknowledge a few limitations within our study. Some models reach very low valid response rates, which may be due to the prompting format. With model-specific prompts, we may be able to extract more clear results for each bias. Additionally, we address the fairly subpar IAA within our human judgment study. This may be due to the difficulty of the task, asking MTurk annotators to rank 15 models to limit the number of comparisons required in a pairwise format, but also increases the complexity of the task itself, which may have caused lower quality in the annotations.\n\nWe also highlight the stability of our findings in the long term. As LLM research is rapidly growing, the capabilities of language models can scale exponentially with time. As such, with new developments being discovered frequently, previous LLM performance on our bias benchmarks may quickly become outdated (i.e. InstructGPT can be considered an "outdated LLM," as the API is also no longer offered on OpenAI’s platforms).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was mainly supported by the research gift from Grammarly. We also thank Minnesota NLP group members for providing us with valuable feedback and comments on the initial draft.\n\n## References\n\n## Appendix A Experimental Setup\n\n### A.1 Model Hyperparameters\n\nWe set the same hyperparameters across models for each evaluation generation and response generation for consistency across all of the models. We limit the max new tokens generated to 128 tokens and set the temperature to 1.0. For Huggingface models, we set a repetition penalty of 1.2 and set the number of beams to 3.\n\n### A.2 Experimental Settings\n\nFor models that are supported (ChatGPT, InstructGPT, GPT-4, Vicuna), we utilize Microsoft Guidance to better control LLM generations. Otherwise, we utilize the transformer pipeline library from Hugginface to retrieve each evaluation generation. Regardless of whether a models generation was collected from guidance or using the transformer pipeline, all parameters were the same. Model generation times for response generation ranged from 1 to 8 hours, and for evaluation generations ranged from 3 to 24 hours for each bias benchmark. All experiments were run on either A5000 or A6000 GPUs for models under 40B parameters. For models over 40B, A100 GPUs were utilized if an API service was not available (e.g. OpenAI, Cohere).\n\n### A.3 Datasets\n\nEli5 (Fan et\xa0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib12)) is a long-form question-answering dataset constructed from 270k𝑘kitalic\\_k threads from the “Explain Like I’m Five” Reddit forum.\nThe online forum consists of a community for individuals to ask various questions, and answers are provided in a format that is comprehensible to five-year-olds, along with assigned scores based on community votes.\nFor our purposes, we only utilize the questions and their highest-rated answers to generate responses and benchmark automatic evaluators for text-generation quality.\n\nBigBench (Srivastava et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib45)) is a collection of benchmarks that look to probe the abilities of language models over a diverse range of tasks. We specifically utilize the strategyQA (Geva et\xa0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib18)) dataset, which was constructed by crowdsourcing questions from writers as well as their responses with short justifications.\nWe choose the strategyQA dataset to generate responses that require multi-step reasoning to effectively benchmark the ability of models to comprehend and compare the quality between two different explanations.\n\n## Appendix B Supplementary Results\n\n### B.1 Correlation between Bandwagon and Percentage\n\nIn an additional experiment, we show a modified statistic for the biased model: "0%percent00\\%0 % of people prefer {model}.” If bias tendency were indeed correlated with the statistic, we would expect the evaluator model to have 0 preference for bandwagon response. Due to limited computation resources and time, we ran the additional experiments for two representative models at each size range (+ all API-based models) and presented the results below in Table [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2.T6 "Table 6 ‣ B.1 Correlation between Bandwagon and Percentage ‣ Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators").\n\nHere, one can observe that the preference choices for the bandwagon statistic greatly change (besides GPT4 and Vicuna) which suggests that indeed the biased tendency is correlated with the bandwagon statistic. However, we see that Vicuna, in particular, is not greatly affected by the statistics. This suggests that within the prompt, the model only focuses on the phrase “people believe that {model} is better” instead of the statistic. Similarly, this may be the case for Alpaca and InstructGPT as well. We also present the results of the bandwagon test by randomly choosing a percentage between 50%percent5050\\%50 % and 85%percent8585\\%85 % in Table [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2.T7 "Table 7 ‣ B.1 Correlation between Bandwagon and Percentage ‣ Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). We continue see that most models demonstrate biased tendencies.\n\n| Models | GPT-4 | ChatGPT | InstuctGPT | Cohere | Alpaca | Vicuna | Baize | WizardLM |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bandwagon (85%) | 0.0 | 0.86 | 0.85 | 0.82 | 0.75 | 0.81 | 0.82 | 0.76 |\n| Bandwagon (0%) | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.56 | 0.0 | 0.52 | 0.79 | 0.32 | 0.27 |\n\n| Models | GPT-4 | ChatGPT | InstuctGPT | Cohere | Alpaca | Vicuna | Baize | WizardLM |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bandwagon (85%) | 0.00.00.00.0 | 0.860.860.860.86 | 0.850.850.850.85 | 0.820.820.820.82 | 0.750.750.750.75 | 0.810.810.810.81 | 0.820.820.820.82 | 0.760.760.760.76 |\n| Bandwagon (50-85%) | 0.060.060.060.06 | 0.700.700.700.70 | 0.840.840.840.84 | 0.650.650.650.65 | 0.680.680.680.68 | 0.960.960.960.96 | 0.750.750.750.75 | 0.760.760.760.76 |\n\n### B.2 Diverse Prompts\n\nWe additionally ask each evaluator to analyze generation quality along several different aspects such as “coherence, accuracy, factuality, and helpfulness” following Bai et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib2)) and Zheng et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib60)). As opposed to our single-aspect format in the main section, we conjecture that these cognitive biases remain regardless of evaluation aspects. To validate this, we constructed an extended prompt viewable in [C.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A3.SS5 "C.5 Diverse Prompt ‣ Appendix C Prompt Templates ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") that incorporates different dimensions of evaluation criteria into our pairwise evaluation prompt and reported their results in Table [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2.T8 "Table 8 ‣ B.2 Diverse Prompts ‣ Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") on the Order benchmark. We see that by including diverse perspectives in the evaluation setting, some metrics become more pronounced (i.e. Cohere for Egocentric) or bias decreases (i.e. Vicuna for Egocentric). However, we see that the proportion of biased evaluations stays relatively consistent for most models on all benchmarks. Hence, our findings remain that models still show a large skewness in bias tendency as evaluators.\n\n| Models | GPT-4 | ChatGPT | InstuctGPT | Cohere | Alpaca | Vicuna | Baize | WizardLM |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Order (coh.) | 0.17Fsubscript0.17𝐹0.17\\_{F}0.17 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.38Fsubscript0.38𝐹0.38\\_{F}0.38 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.24Lsubscript0.24𝐿0.24\\_{L}0.24 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.33Fsubscript0.33𝐹0.33\\_{F}0.33 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.82Lsubscript0.82𝐿0.82\\_{L}0.82 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.32Fsubscript0.32𝐹0.32\\_{F}0.32 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.95Lsubscript0.95𝐿0.95\\_{L}0.95 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.64Lsubscript0.64𝐿0.64\\_{L}0.64 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT |\n| Order (div.) | 0.14Fsubscript0.14𝐹0.14\\_{F}0.14 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.45Fsubscript0.45𝐹0.45\\_{F}0.45 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.22Lsubscript0.22𝐿0.22\\_{L}0.22 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.23Lsubscript0.23𝐿0.23\\_{L}0.23 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.76Lsubscript0.76𝐿0.76\\_{L}0.76 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.52Fsubscript0.52𝐹0.52\\_{F}0.52 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.83Lsubscript0.83𝐿0.83\\_{L}0.83 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.68Lsubscript0.68𝐿0.68\\_{L}0.68 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT |\n| Egocent.

Note that for Salience, if a pairwise sample was labeled as “Tie,” we do not consider it for length bias. From Table [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2.T9 "Table 9 ‣ B.3 Prompting with Ties ‣ Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") we see that the inclusion of the tie option does view a considerable change in the bias benchmarks. Notably, the strongest and smallest models (GPT-4, ChatGPT, Baize, WizardLM) do not exhibit any change. However, we see that the mid-range models (Alpaca, Vicuna) and InstructGPT display a large preference for assigning the tie label (≥∼90%\\geq\\sim 90\\%≥ ∼ 90 %) that does not present any valid results, to which we had originally only prompted two options for each evaluator to avoid this issue. The only model that demonstrated an improvement from previous bias behavior was Cohere.\n\n| Models | GPT-4 | ChatGPT | InstuctGPT | Cohere | Alpaca | Vicuna | Baize | WizardLM |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Order | 0.17Fsubscript0.17𝐹0.17\\_{F}0.17 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.38Fsubscript0.38𝐹0.38\\_{F}0.38 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.24Lsubscript0.24𝐿0.24\\_{L}0.24 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.33Fsubscript0.33𝐹0.33\\_{F}0.33 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.82Lsubscript0.82𝐿0.82\\_{L}0.82 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.32Fsubscript0.32𝐹0.32\\_{F}0.32 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.95Lsubscript0.95𝐿0.95\\_{L}0.95 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.64Lsubscript0.64𝐿0.64\\_{L}0.64 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT |\n| Order (tie) | 0.15Fsubscript0.15𝐹0.15\\_{F}0.15 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.43Fsubscript0.43𝐹0.43\\_{F}0.43 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_F end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.00.00.00.0 | 0.08Lsubscript0.08𝐿0.08\\_{L}0.08 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.00.00.00.0 | 0.00.00.00.0 | 0.81Lsubscript0.81𝐿0.81\\_{L}0.81 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | 0.47Lsubscript0.47𝐿0.47\\_{L}0.47 start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_L end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT |\n| Tie (%) | 0.010.010.010.01 | 0.00.00.00.0 | 0.880.880.880.88 | 0.330.330.330.33 | 0.950.950.950.95 | 0.990.990.990.99 | 0.00.00.00.0 | 0.040.040.040.04 |\n| Egocentric | 0.780.780.780.78 | 0.580.580.580.58 | 0.280.280.280.28 | 0.270.270.270.27 | 0.180.180.180.18 | 0.270.270.270.27 | 0.020.020.020.02 | 0.140.140.140.14 |\n| Egocentric (tie) | 0.770.770.770.77 | 0.600.600.600.60 | 0.040.040.040.04 | 0.250.250.250.25 | 0.020.020.020.02 | 0.00.00.00.0 | 0.080.080.080.08 | 0.160.160.160.16 |\n| Salience | 0.560.560.560.56 | 0.630.630.630.63 | 0.660.660.660.66 | 0.600.600.600.60 | 0.470.470.470.47 | 0.530.530.530.53 | 0.490.490.490.49 | 0.530.530.530.53 |\n| Salience (tie) | 0.550.550.550.55 | 0.670.670.670.67 | 0.060.060.060.06 | 0.350.350.350.35 | 0.010.010.010.01 | 0.00.00.00.0 | 0.500.500.500.50 | 0.480.480.480.48 |\n\n### B.4 Decoupling Confounding Factors\n\nWe particularly focus on decoupling Egocentric and Salience, which are the most prone to having large correlations with each other (i.e. longer generations may indeed have overall higher quality generated by much stronger models).We highlight two important aspects regarding the identification of these biases:\n\nIf multiple models have a large proportion of evaluations preferring their own responses (as the evaluated pool of pairwise instances is the same for each evaluator), we reason that this may suggest “egocentric” qualities within involved evaluators, regardless of the objective strength of the models. Moreover, we see this effect is especially demonstrated between the more powerful models as well (GPT4 & ChatGPT) that suggest the presence of Egocentric evaluations from their disagreement.\n\nWe employ various strategies to mitigate these confounding variables and isolate each analysis as much as possible. For example, we employ a “hierarchical” rubric, where some biases take priority in an evaluation. Specifically, if an evaluation shows signs of order bias by choosing A in (A first, then B) and B in (B first, then A), we do not evaluate it for Salience or Egocentric bias.\n\nTo get further insight into decoupling them, we examine additional statistics in Table [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2.T11 "Table 11 ‣ B.5 Significance of Results ‣ Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") displaying the proportion of Egocentric samples where the model’s generation was longer/shorter than the other generation. In particular, since Olmo only won once, and LLaMA never won, their Egocentric ratios look weird. Otherwise,\nwe view overall that most models (9/16) exhibit a self-preference for their own generations often when their own generations exhibit longer token length.\n\nAs above, we see that Salience may be associated with higher quality generations, as we see that the strongest models (GPT4, ChatGPT) often prefer their own responses when their generations are longer. Nevertheless, even in smaller models (e.g., Cohere, Koala), preference for their own generations occurs more often when they are longer. However, as we previously emphasized, if multiple models observe a self-preference for their own generations, it is difficult to associate with Salience as there is disagreement that is indicative of an Egocentric bias.\n\n### B.5 Significance of Results\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Model | First Order Z-Score | First Order P-Value | Last Order Z-Score | Last Order P-Value |\n| GPT-4 | 8.458.458.458.45 | 2.82\u2062e−172.82𝑒172.82e{-17}2.82 italic\\_e - 17 | 26.5526.5526.5526.55 | 2.65\u2062e−1552.65𝑒1552.65e{-155}2.65 italic\\_e - 155 |\n| ChatGPT | −15.6115.61-15.61- 15.61 | 6.68\u2062e−556.68𝑒556.68e{-55}6.68 italic\\_e - 55 | 32.4332.4332.4332.43 | 9.50\u2062e−2319.50𝑒2319.50e{-231}9.50 italic\\_e - 231 |\n| InstructGPT | 13.0413.0413.0413.04 | 7.08\u2062e−397.08𝑒397.08e{-39}7.08 italic\\_e - 39 | 1.171.171.171.17 | 2.4\u2062e−12.4𝑒12.4e{-1}2.4 italic\\_e - 1 |\n| LLaMAv2 | −33.1233.12-33.12- 33.12 | 1.30\u2062e−2401.30𝑒2401.30e{-240}1.30 italic\\_e - 240 | 17.9717.9717.9717.97 | 3.53\u2062e−723.53𝑒723.53e{-72}3.53 italic\\_e - 72 |\n| LLaMA | −40.8440.84-40.84- 40.84 | 00 | 15.3615.3615.3615.36 | 2.95\u2062e−532.95𝑒532.95e{-53}2.95 italic\\_e - 53 |\n| Cohere | −10.0210.02-10.02- 10.02 | 1.20\u2062e−231.20𝑒231.20e{-23}1.20 italic\\_e - 23 | 8.988.988.988.98 | 2.59\u2062e−192.59𝑒192.59e{-19}2.59 italic\\_e - 19 |\n| Falcon | −57.3657.36-57.36- 57.36 | 00 | 25.6125.6125.6125.61 | 1.24\u2062e−1441.24𝑒1441.24e{-144}1.24 italic\\_e - 144 |\n| Alpaca | 30.6730.6730.6730.67 | 1.29\u2062e−2061.29𝑒2061.29e{-206}1.29 italic\\_e - 206 | −61.4561.45-61.45- 61.45 | 00 |\n| Vicuna | −12.4912.49-12.49- 12.49 | 8.44\u2062e−368.44𝑒368.44e{-36}8.44 italic\\_e - 36 | 7.637.637.637.63 | 2.29\u2062e−142.29𝑒142.29e{-14}2.29 italic\\_e - 14 |\n| OpenAssist | −37.2737.27-37.27- 37.27 | 4.84\u2062e−3044.84𝑒3044.84e{-304}4.84 italic\\_e - 304 | 13.9313.9313.9313.93 | 3.92\u2062e−443.92𝑒443.92e{-44}3.92 italic\\_e - 44 |\n| Mistral | −20.0920.09-20.09- 20.09 | 9.13\u2062e−909.13𝑒909.13e{-90}9.13 italic\\_e - 90 | 32.5632.5632.5632.56 | 1.63\u2062e−2321.63𝑒2321.63e{-232}1.63 italic\\_e - 232 |\n| OLMO | −54.5454.54-54.54- 54.54 | 00 | 22.0822.0822.0822.08 | 4.47\u2062e−1084.47𝑒1084.47e{-108}4.47 italic\\_e - 108 |\n| Baize | 35.4635.4635.4635.46 | 1.99\u2062e−2751.99𝑒2751.99e{-275}1.99 italic\\_e - 275 | −71.5371.53-71.53- 71.53 | 00 |\n| Koala | −21.6021.60-21.60- 21.60 | 1.77\u2062e−1031.77𝑒1031.77e{-103}1.77 italic\\_e - 103 | 12.1812.1812.1812.18 | 4.15\u2062e−344.15𝑒344.15e{-34}4.15 italic\\_e - 34 |\n| WizardLM | 20.6520.6520.6520.65 | 9.93\u2062e−959.93𝑒959.93e{-95}9.93 italic\\_e - 95 | −40.4840.48-40.48- 40.48 | 00 |\n| MPT | −30.7130.71-30.71- 30.71 | 4.81\u2062e−2074.81𝑒2074.81e{-207}4.81 italic\\_e - 207 | 16.4916.4916.4916.49 | 4.62\u2062e−614.62𝑒614.62e{-61}4.62 italic\\_e - 61 |\n\nWe adapt two statistical hypothesis tests based on the random bias threshold for the Order bias (first-order and last-order) benchmark in Table [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2.T10 "Table 10 ‣ B.5 Significance of Results ‣ Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). Since we have binary outputs (bias, not biased), we conduct a two-sample Z test of proportions to determine the significance of each proportion of biased evaluations from each automatic evaluator with the random baseline. We conduct the test with the null hypothesis defined to be that “evaluator X is just as likely to make the mistake of flipping its preference according to the order of the response to the first-order as the random baseline” or equivalently:\n\nH0subscript𝐻0H\\_{0}italic\\_H start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT: the mean of Evaluator X𝑋Xitalic\\_X for first-order bias is not any different from random selection.\n\nOn almost all of the Order benchmarks, the proportions of biased evaluations are statistically significant from ones by the random score.

Also, we note that the p-value is actually not statistically significant for last-order bias in InstructGPT; however, the first-order proportions are statistically significant, indicating that one must consider the test for both positions to get the full picture of the evaluator’s tendencies in reference to the random baseline. For example, if both first-order and last-order were not statistically significant from the random proportions, we might find that the evaluator is “unbiased,” but the following may also undermine the capabilities of the automatic evaluator reduced to just random choice.\n\n|  | GPT4 | ChatGPT | InstructGPT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ego | 0.78 | 0.58 | 0.28 |\n| Longer Ego | 0.64 | 0.75 | 0.43 |\n| Shorter Ego | 0.36 | 0.25 | 0.56 |\n\n|  | LLaMAv2 | LLaMA | Cohere | Falcon |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ego | 0.06 | 0.0 | 0.27 | 0.05 |\n| Longer Ego | 0.18 | 0.0 | 0.68 | 0.6 |\n| Shorter Ego | 0.81 | 0.0 | 0.32 | 0.4 |\n\n|  | Alpaca | Vicuna | OpenAssist |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ego | 0.18 | 0.27 | 0.15 |\n| Longer Ego | 0.38 | 0.4 | 0.71 |\n| Shorter Ego | 0.62 | 0.59 | 0.29 |\n\n|  | Mistral | OLMO | Baize | Koala | WizardLM | MPT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ego | 0.3 | 0.0 | 0.02 | 0.48 | 0.14 | 0.21 |\n| Longer Ego | 0.64 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.56 | 0.54 | 0.83 |\n| Shorter Ego | 0.36 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.44 | 0.46 | 0.17 |\n\n![Refer to caption](x5.png)\n\n### B.6 LLM Performance and Agreement\n\nWe detail the general agreement between machine preferences as similarly conducted in the human-machine correlation study.

For example, models in the largest size group (>>>100\u2062B100𝐵100B100 italic\\_B) are more in agreement amongst themselves than with models from other size groups. Furthermore, we also show the average valid response rate from different bias promptings in Table [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2.T12 "Table 12 ‣ B.6 LLM Performance and Agreement ‣ Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). We gather the proportion of valid responses by post-processing each “eval-gen” via pattern matching. After post-processing, we then label each output as a valid or invalid response, such that if a response is valid, we give one point to the preferred system.\n\n![Refer to caption](x6.png)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Model | Avg. | Ord. | Comp. | Band. | Attn. |\n| GPT4 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 0.97 | 0.99 | 0.99 |\n| ChatGPT | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 |\n| InstructGPT | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 1.00 | 0.99 |\n| LLaMAv2 | 0.54 | 0.17 | 0.40 | 0.43 | 0.91 |\n| LLaMA | 0.14 | 0.22 | 0.16 | 0.03 | 0.58 |\n| Cohere | 0.98 | 0.94 | 0.99 | 0.82 | 0.99 |\n| Falcon | 0.72 | 0.72 | 0.46 | 0.99 | 0.98 |\n| Alpaca | 0.84 | 0.78 | 0.82 | 0.97 | 0.87 |\n| Vicuna | 0.86 | 0.90 | 0.71 | 0.97 | 0.90 |\n| OpenAssist | 0.60 | 0.80 | 0.32 | 0.95 | 0.94 |\n| Mistral | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 |\n| Olmo | 0.25 | 0.36 | 0.06 | 0.42 | 0.15 |\n| Baize | 0.96 | 0.98 | 0.87 | 0.99 | 0.99 |\n| Koala | 0.25 | 0.29 | 0.18 | 0.23 | 0.30 |\n| WizardLM | 0.93 | 0.95 | 0.83 | 0.99 | 0.96 |\n| MPT | 0.77 | 0.82 | 0.72 | 0.84 | 0.32 |\n\n| Model | Size | Order | | Compassion | | Egocent. | | Salience | Bandwag. | Attent. | Avg.

We present results from a range of model sizes with LLaMAv2 and Vicuna.\nInterestingly, we see that the valid response rate within LLaMAv2 goes down as the model size is scaled up, but the impact of each bias greatly increases as the model size is scaled down (with the exception of Salience Bias). On the implicit bias benchmarks, LLaMAv2 exhibits more robust performance with the proportion of responses affected by each bias Salience Bias in which longer responses are much more strongly preferred. For the induced bias benchmarks, a similar trend is viewed in which the effect of each bias on the model as an evaluator is dampened in correlation to the model scale. On the contrary, Vicuna exhibits a stronger valid response rate as the model size is scaled; however, certain implicit biases are much more amplified, such as Order Bias and Salience Bias. For implicit biases, Vicuna tends to prefer itself when actual model names are used as size is scaled smaller while tending to prefer much more verbose responses as model size is scaled higher. Across the induced biases, Vicuna performs more resiliently proportionally to scale, although still strongly influenced by Bandwagon Effect but much less affected by Attentional Bias. We include another visualization correlating the overall performance on each of the bias benchmarks with model size for the main results in Figure [2(a)](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.F2.sf1 "In Figure 2 ‣ Benchmarking ‣ 4.2 Text Evaluation Setting ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators").\n\n| Model | Size | Valid Response | Order bias | ChatGPT avg. rank | Falcon avg. rank | Alpaca avg. rank | Vicuna avg. rank |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ChatGPT | - | 0.94 | 0.32 | 2.3 | 2.5 | 2.6 | 2.6 |\n| Falcon | 40B | 0.38 | 0.39 | 2.6 | 2.3 | 2.6 | 2.5 |\n| Alpaca | 13B | 0.65 | 1.0 | 2.6 | 2.4 | 2.4 | 2.4 |\n| Vicuna | 7B | 0.02 | 0.0 | 1.5 | 4.0 | 3.0 | 1.5 |\n\n### B.8 N𝑁Nitalic\\_N-Rankwise setting: N=4𝑁4N=4italic\\_N = 4\n\nWe show the results and average rankings between four different models representing each of the different size groups: ChatGPT (>>>100\u2062B100𝐵100B100 italic\\_B), Falcon (>>>40\u2062B40𝐵40B40 italic\\_B), Alpaca (>>>10\u2062B10𝐵10B10 italic\\_B), Vicuna (<<<10\u2062B10𝐵10B10 italic\\_B).\n\nFor the experimental setup, we conduct a smaller study, generating 100 responses from each of the 4 different LLMs using the Databricks Dolly15k dataset (Conover et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib9)) via the same instruction prompt template from Appendix [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A3 "Appendix C Prompt Templates ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") and the same evaluation prompt template from the Order bias.\n\nWe only employ this setting under the order bias setting in order to validate the complexity of the task that modern (smaller) LLMs aren’t capable of performing yet. We perform each experiment by randomizing the order of each list of responses and prompt each LM-as-evaluator to order the list from best to worst (top to bottom) according to the same criterion as the pairwise study (providing the instruction/sample reference). Furthermore, we also track Order bias, calculated by the proportion of responses in which the first (randomly) placed model was also ranked first by the evaluator.\n\nAs viewed in Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A2.T14 "Table 14 ‣ B.7 Model Size ‣ Appendix B Supplementary Results ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"), we find that most models besides the closed-source API models (e.g. OpenAI) have trouble generating a proper rank list for even an N=4𝑁4N=4italic\\_N = 4 setting. This may be due to the increased complexity of the task (Dziri et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib11)) where the ranking of N𝑁Nitalic\\_N generations may become much more difficult as N𝑁Nitalic\\_N gets larger (since the task complexity increases).\n\n## Appendix C Prompt Templates\n\nWe present each evaluation prompt utilized for models to evaluate the quality between two generations. We show each of the prompts (Compassion, Bandwagon, Attentional) derived from the original Order prompt in Section [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.SS2 "4.2 Text Evaluation Setting ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). We highlight each modification made from the original template.\n\nOur generation instruction template looks like the following:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ### Instruction: |\n| ### Response: |\n\nFor evaluation, bias-specific prompts are formatted as follows:\n\n### C.1 Order\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ### Instruction: Which system’s response is more coherent considering the reference and instruction? |\n| The instruction is: {{instruction}} |\n| The reference is: {{reference}} |\n| “‘ |\n| System Star: |\n| System Square: |\n| “‘ |\n| Please respond in the following format strictly: System \\_ is better |\n| Do not provide any additional text or explanation: |\n| ### Response: |\n\nAlso, we underline that Egocentric bias was extracted under two dimensions, hence its double column for (Order / Compassion) in Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Identifying Biases in Pairwise Human Preference ‣ 4.3 Human Preference Study ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). Since Egocentric is a bias extracted implicitly, it involves two different prompts from C.1 (Order) and C.2 (Compassion Fade). In the case of C.1, since model names are completely anonymous, the addition of “(You)” is omitted (as shown in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"), and models cannot tell if they are self-evaluating. In contrast, C.2 shows recognizable names; thus, “(You)” is appended to the system name when self-evaluating. We highlight that the added “(You)” within the Egocentric example in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") serves to explicitly communicate an example of an egocentric bias to the reader and not necessarily the prompt itself.\n\n### C.2 Compassion Fade\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ### Instruction: Which system’s response is more coherent considering |\n| the reference and instruction? |\n| The instruction is: {{instruction}} |\n| The reference is: {{reference}} |\n| “‘ |\n| {model1\\_name}: {model1\\_response} |\n| {model2\\_name}: {model2\\_response} |\n| “‘ |\n| Please response directly in the following format: System \\_ is better |\n| Do not provide any additional text or explanation: |\n| ### Response: |\n\n### C.3 Bandwagon Effect\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ### Instruction: Which system’s response is more coherent considering |\n| the reference and instruction? |\n| The instruction is: {{instruction}} |\n| The reference is: {{reference}} |\n| “‘ |\n| System Star: {model1\\_response} |\n| System Square: {model2\\_response} |\n| “‘ |\n| 85% of people believe that {system} is better. |\n| Please response directly in the following format: System \\_ is better |\n| Do not provide any additional text or explanation: |\n| ### Response: |\n\n### C.4 Attentional Bias\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ### Instruction: Which system’s response is more coherent considering the reference and instruction? |\n| The instruction is: {{instruction}} |\n| The reference is: {{reference}} |\n| “‘ |\n| System Star: {model1\\_response} |\n| System Square: {model2\\_response} |\n| “‘ |\n| {distraction} |\n| Please response directly in the following format: System \\_ is better |\n| Do not provide any additional text or explanation: |\n| ### Response: |\n\n| Attentional Bank |\n| --- |\n| {System} likes to eat apples and oranges. |\n| The coolest thing that {System} can do is a 60 second handstand. |\n| {System} plays a lot of soccer and basketball. |\n| {System} has been all around Europe two times. |\n\n### C.5 Diverse Prompt\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ### Instruction: Which system’s response is more coherent, accurate, factual, and helpful considering the reference and instruction? |\n| The instruction is: {{instruction}} |\n| The reference is: {{reference}} |\n| “‘ |\n| System Star: {model1\\_response} |\n| System Square: {model2\\_response} |\n| “‘ |\n| Please response directly in the following format: System \\_ is better |\n| Do not provide any additional text or explanation: |\n| ### Response: |\n\n### C.6 Tie Prompt\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ### Instruction: Which system’s response is more coherent considering the reference and instruction? |\n| The instruction is: {{instruction}} |\n| The reference is: {{reference}} |\n| “‘ |\n| System Star: {model1\\_response} |\n| System Square: {model2\\_response} |\n| “‘ |\n| If you believe each response is equally sufficient simply respond with: Tie |\n| Please response directly in the following format: System \\_ is better |\n| Do not provide any additional text or explanation: |\n| ### Response: |\n\n## Appendix D Human Preference Study\n\n### D.1 Annotator Recruitment & Annotation Process\n\n##### N=13-rankwise setting\n\nWe recruited six workers from the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform, each of whom had a U.S. high school diploma and a Human Intelligence Task (HIT) approval rate of 99% or higher on the platform. To ensure better-quality annotations, we initiated a toy round using five sample instruction sets. Each instruction in the toy round contained five brief LLM-generated sentences. Workers were then asked to rank these sentences based on their own preferences, but taking into account the following two specific criteria: (1) the fluency and logical coherence of the LLM-generated text in response to a given instruction sentence, and (2) the text’s alignment with a reference sentence that provided additional context and background for the instruction sentence. Furthermore, they were asked to place a black bar above the answers that did not satisfy these two criteria, as this is used for the threshold to evaluate the quality of their texts.\n\nAfter each participant finished their annotation during the toy round, we carefully reviewed their submissions to ensure they had accurately followed the guidelines and considered the two ranking criteria and the position of black bar. For their efforts, each participant received a $3 payment for completing the toy round (HIT). Running the toy HIT several times yielded a final selection of six qualified workers, who were then invited to participate in the next stage involving the actual task of ranking 50 instruction sets. Each of these sets included 13 texts generated by 13 different LLMs. Note that LLaMA2, Mistral, and OLMo were not included yet at the time of our human study.\n\nTo avoid overwhelming the workers, we divided the main task into five separate HITs, each containing a varying number of instruction sets to rank: (1) a pilot round with 5 sets, (2) two intermediate rounds with 10 sets each, and (3) two final rounds with 13 and 12 sets, respectively, adding up to a total of 50 instruction sets. These six workers received compensation upon completing each HIT, accumulating to a minimum of $47 for the entire series of rounds. This averaged out to approximately $1.05 per instruction set. Additionally, on average, it took each of the six workers about 5.8 minutes to complete a single instruction set. Lastly, considering the level of difficulty for the workers to rank 13 outputs per instruction set, we also remunerated them with a bonus of at least $5 per round, based on the quality of their performance. Lastly, we checked that our collected data did not include any personally identifiable information or offensive content and that the AMT responses were already anonymized.\n\n##### Bias in Pairwise Human Preference\n\nFor each bias, we collected human preferences from 75 experienced AMT workers who had HIT approval rates over 97%, had completed more than 10,000 HIT tasks, and resided in five major English-speaking countries (e.g., the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.) These workers were then grouped into 25 sets of 3, with each group assigned a HIT task encompassing 30 model pairs randomly sampled from an instruction. Consequently, we generated 25 HITs for each bias. These workers were tasked with choosing between two anonymous options (e.g., System A and B) for each of the 30 pairs. Their decisions were purely based on their preference, but we also asked them to consider the alignment and coherency with the instruction and reference sentences of each set.\n\nTo employ a pre-task and training session, we asked the participating workers of each HIT to complete a qualification round, which asked three example instructions to complete and pass. Only workers who passed this round were allowed to start the main tasks of annotating 30 pairs, ensuring that the workers were able to understand the HIT. Each worker who participated in a HIT received a compensation of $2.5. Note that Slience Bias were computed using the annotations from Order Bias experiments on the AMT platform.\n\nSimilarly, we confirmed that our collected data did not include any personally identifiable information or offensive content and that the AMT responses were already anonymized.\n\n### D.2 Details on using RBO\n\nRank-biased overlap (RBO) 888We implemented RBO using the python package ‘rbo’: <https://pypi.org/project/rbo/>. is a widely used metric for evaluating the similarity between two ranked lists and is particularly relevant for tasks in information retrieval (Oh et\xa0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib35); Sun et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib46)). The RBO value ranges from 0 (non-conjoint) to 1 (identical). In more detail, 0 indicates that there is no intersection or similarity, while 1 indicates a total intersection and complete similarity between two ranked lists, A and B, in terms of ranked elements and order. Unlike classical correlation-based metrics such as Kendall’s tau or Spearman’s rank correlation, RBO is intersection-based, so there is no criteria range of value for RBO regarding the interpretation of its score. Rather, a higher continuous value of RBO means a higher ranking similarity between A and B.\n\nIn addition, unlike traditional correlation-based metrics like Kendall’s τ𝜏\\tauitalic\\_τ or Spearman’s ρ𝜌\\rhoitalic\\_ρ, RBO allows for greater weighting of the top k𝑘kitalic\\_k elements in the ranked lists being compared. This feature makes RBO well-suited for our experimental setup, where AMT workers were tasked with reading and ranking 13 outputs generated by LLMs. We operate under the assumption that workers are likely to place the highest-quality texts at the top five positions of their ranked lists.\n\nThis idea of weighing the top elements in the ranked outputs aligns with previous research, which claims RBO to be an effective metric for the agreement between ranked annotations with human rationals and automated evaluations, especially when greater importance is given to the top-ranked elements (Jørgensen et\xa0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib24)). Given these considerations, which are highly relevant to our own study, we decided to use RBO as the metric for assessing agreement between human preferences and LLM evaluations.\n\nRBO is defined in Equation [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A4.E1 "In D.2 Details on using RBO ‣ Appendix D Human Preference Study ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") and tailored to suit the specifics of our study. Here, H𝐻Hitalic\\_H and L𝐿Litalic\\_L represent two ranked lists of shape (1,13)113(1,13)( 1 , 13 ), corresponding to human preferences and LLM evaluations for each instruction set, respectively. The maximum depth for H𝐻Hitalic\\_H and L𝐿Litalic\\_L is set at 13, and p𝑝pitalic\\_p is a tunable parameter that determines the degree of top-weightedness in the final RBO calculation. To obtain an average RBO score across all 50 instructions, we sum the individual RBO values between H𝐻Hitalic\\_H and L𝐿Litalic\\_L and then divide by 50.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | R\u2062B\u2062O\u2062(H,L)=(1−p)\u2062∑d=113pd−1\u2062|A[1:d]∩B[1:d]|d\\centering RBO(H,L)=(1-p)\\sum\\_{d=1}^{13}p^{d-1}\\frac{|A[1:d]\\cap B[1:d]|}{d}\\@add@centeringitalic\\_R italic\\_B italic\\_O ( italic\\_H , italic\\_L ) = ( 1 - italic\\_p ) ∑ start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_d = 1 end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 13 end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_p start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_d - 1 end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start\\_ARG | italic\\_A [ 1 : italic\\_d ] ∩ italic\\_B [ 1 : italic\\_d ] | end\\_ARG start\\_ARG italic\\_d end\\_ARG |  | (1) |\n\nFollowing the work of Webber et\xa0al. ([2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib55)), we set the value of p𝑝pitalic\\_p so that approximately 86% of the weight is concentrated on the first d𝑑ditalic\\_d ranks, where d=5𝑑5d=5italic\\_d = 5 in our case. The weight distribution over these top d𝑑ditalic\\_d ranks can be determined using Equation [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A4.E2 "In D.2 Details on using RBO ‣ Appendix D Human Preference Study ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). This means that the value of Equation (2) given d=5𝑑5d=5italic\\_d = 5 should be 0.86. In our experimental setup, we found that p𝑝pitalic\\_p was approximately 0.8.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | (1−pd−1)+(1−pp)⋅d⋅(ln\u206111−p−∑i=1d−1pii)1superscript𝑝𝑑1⋅1𝑝𝑝𝑑11𝑝superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑑1superscript𝑝𝑖𝑖\\centering(1-p^{d-1})+(\\frac{1-p}{p})\\cdot d\\cdot\\left(\\ln\\frac{1}{1-p}-\\sum\\_{% i=1}^{d-1}\\frac{p^{i}}{i}\\right)\\@add@centering( 1 - italic\\_p start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_d - 1 end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) + ( divide start\\_ARG 1 - italic\\_p end\\_ARG start\\_ARG italic\\_p end\\_ARG ) ⋅ italic\\_d ⋅ ( roman\\_ln divide start\\_ARG 1 end\\_ARG start\\_ARG 1 - italic\\_p end\\_ARG - ∑ start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i = 1 end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_d - 1 end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start\\_ARG italic\\_p start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end\\_ARG start\\_ARG italic\\_i end\\_ARG ) |  | (2) |\n\n### D.3 Details on Pairwise Human Preference Experiments\n\nIn pairwise human preference experiments, we did not test the Compassion Fade and Egocentric Bias as they cannot be applied to human cases, because humans are not likely to be impacted by the anonymity of model names and the texts used in our setups are not generated by humans as well.\n\nUnlike pairwise model evaluation as described in Section [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.SS2 "4.2 Text Evaluation Setting ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"), we were not able to evaluate with humans all possible 5,250 model pairs. Instead, we first randomly selected 25 of the 50 total instructions. Then for each instruction, we produced 15 pairs of randomly sampled model outputs and created another 15 pairs by reversing their order (for Order Bias) or switching the bias-induced sentence between A or B (for Bandwagon Effect and Attentional Bias). This results in 30 pairs (with 15 unique model pairs) in total for each instruction and finally totals 750 pairs for all 25 instructions. Note that the sample size ensured a 95% confidence level with a 5% margin of error for a population size of 5250.\n\nUpon collecting all annotations for each bias, we calculated the average IAA using the RBO for each bias. Each instruction consisted of uniquely (but randomly) sampled model pairs, with some models appearing multiple times. Hence, we normalized the rank of each model in the sampled pairs by calculating the ratio of the model’s “win” to its total appearances. With this data, we re-ranked each model in the sampled pairs per instruction. Afterward, we computed the mean RBO among the ranked model lists from each group of three AMT workers per instruction. We then averaged these RBO values over all 25 instructions to calculate the IAA scores for each bias experiment.\n\nFinally, we computed the bias proportion for each annotator by dividing the number of biased pairwise samples by 15. Following these steps, we aggregated the bias proportions across all annotators, showing the degrees of impact of bias on human preference in pairwise selections. For Salience Bias, we leveraged annotations from Order Bias experiments and calculated proportions for shorter and longer preferred responses. We then reported the preference with a higher average proportion that was computed all across annotators, indicating whether humans were more influenced by shorter or longer length bias.\n\n### D.4 Details on Pairwise Human Preference Samples\n\nWe clarify that for each one of the three bias measurements, a random sample of 750 model pairs was tested by three annotators in the pairwise human experiment setup, totaling 2250 samples for 3 annotators. More formally, we define:\n\nB(=3)annotated𝐵absent3B(=3)italic\\_B ( = 3 ): Number of bias experiments (B\\_salience, B\\_order, B\\_bandwagon)\n\nS(=25)annotated𝑆absent25S(=25)italic\\_S ( = 25 ): Number of samples selected for each bias experiment\n\nP(=15)annotated𝑃absent15P(=15)italic\\_P ( = 15 ): Number of original model output pairs (Model A - Model B) for each sample\n\nM(=2)annotated𝑀absent2M(=2)italic\\_M ( = 2 ): Multiplier for both orderings of each pairwise sample (i.e., for each A-B we also add B-A)\n\nA(=3)annotated𝐴absent3A(=3)italic\\_A ( = 3 ): Number of human annotators evaluating each model pair\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | TpairssubscriptTpairs\\displaystyle\\mathrm{T\\_{\\text{pairs}}}roman\\_T start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT pairs end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | =Total # of model pairs for one biasabsentTotal # of model pairs for one bias\\displaystyle=\\mathrm{\\text{Total \\# of model pairs for one bias}}= Total # of model pairs for one bias |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | =S×P×M=750absent𝑆𝑃𝑀750\\displaystyle=S\\times P\\times M=750= italic\\_S × italic\\_P × italic\\_M = 750 |  |\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | TevalssubscriptTevals\\displaystyle\\mathrm{T\\_{\\text{evals}}}roman\\_T start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT evals end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | =total # of human evaluations for one biasabsenttotal # of human evaluations for one bias\\displaystyle=\\mathrm{\\text{total \\# of human evaluations for one bias}}= total # of human evaluations for one bias |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | =Tpairs×A=750×3=2250absentsubscript𝑇pairs𝐴75032250\\displaystyle=T\\_{\\text{pairs}}\\times A=750\\times 3=2250= italic\\_T start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT pairs end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT × italic\\_A = 750 × 3 = 2250 |  |\n\nThus, we analyze 2250×B=67502250𝐵67502250\\times B=67502250 × italic\\_B = 6750 samples across all bias setups.\n\n### D.5 Interface Design\n\nWe present the interface design temple for each of the human preference experiments setups on the AMT platform, including (1) N-rankwise setups (N=13) and (2) bias in pairwise human preference, as described in Section [4.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#S4.SS3 "4.3 Human Preference Study ‣ 4 Experiment Setup ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators"). The original prototype of the interfaces that we used for the N-rankwise experiments, as in Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#A4.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ D.5 Interface Design ‣ Appendix D Human Preference Study ‣ Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators") is based on <https://github.com/mtreviso/TextRankerJS>. For the pairwise human bias experiments, we referenced the interface design from Hayati et\xa0al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.17012v3#bib.bib20)).\n\n![Refer to caption](x7.png)\n![Refer to caption](x8.png)\n![Refer to caption](x9.png)\n![Refer to caption](x10.png)\n![Mascot Sammy](data:image/png;base64,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)')]), SearchResults(query=Query(query='limitations of current LLM benchmarks versus real-world application needs'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.dataforce.ai/blog/disadvantages-standard-llm-benchmarks', title='Disadvantages of Standard LLM Benchmarks', raw_content="![](https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=7802809&fmt=gif)\n![Home](/sites/default/files/dataforce-tp-logo-white.png)\n\n## Main navigation\n\n[Services](/services)\n\n![Data Collection](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Data-Collection.png)\n![Data Annotation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Data-Annotation.png)\n![Transcription](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Transcription.png)\n![Chatbot Localization](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Chatbot-Localization.png)\n![Generative AI](/sites/default/files/inline-images/genai2.png)\n![User Studies](/sites/default/files/inline-images/User-Studies-1.png)\n![Data Relevance](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Data-Relevance-and-Rating.png)\n![Data Moderation](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Data-Moderation.png)\n![Business Process Outsourcing](/sites/default/files/inline-images/ICON_BPO.png)\n![Ethical AI](/sites/default/files/inline-images/EthicalAI_Icon.png)\n\n[Industries](/industries)\n\n![Automotive](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Automotive_1.png)\n![Cybersecurity](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Cybersecurity.png)\n![Finance](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Finance.png)\n![Gaming](/sites/default/files/inline-images/GamingIcon.png)\n![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Life%20Sciences.png)\n![Manufacturing](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Manufacturing.png)\n![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Retail.png)\n![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Technology.png)\n![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Travel.png)\n\n[Success Stories](/success-stories)\n\n![Service AI Filter](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Success-Stories-Filter-by-Service.png)\n![Technology AI Filter](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Success-Stories-Filter-by-Technology.png)\n![Industry AI Filter](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Success-Stories-Filter-by-Industry.png)\n\n[Resources](/resources)\n\n![DataForce Live](/sites/default/files/inline-images/DataForce-Live.png)\n![Video Hub](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Educational%20Video%20Hub.png)\n![DataForce Blog](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Blog-Posts.png)\n![Presentations](/sites/default/files/inline-images/DataForce-Presentations.png)\n![Additional Resources](/sites/default/files/inline-images/Additional-Resources.png)\n![News](/sites/default/files/2023-11/df-news.png)\n\n# The Disadvantages of Standard LLM Benchmarks\n\n![Disadvantages of Standard LLM Benchmarks ](/sites/default/files/2025-07/image_16_9.jpg)\n![](/images/down-arrow-w.png)\n\nAs large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, so must the way we evaluate them. Standardized benchmark test sets like [MMLU](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mmlu), [HellaSwag](https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag/), and [TruthfulQA](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/truthfulqa) have become the default tools for performance evaluation. But there’s a growing concern: many of these benchmarks are publicly available and widely used during model pretraining, which means we’re often testing LLMs on data they’ve already seen.\n\nTo address this, organizations are increasingly turning to private, custom datasets to gain a more accurate picture of real-world performance.\n\n## The Problem with Public LLM Benchmarks\n\n### 1. Contamination from Pre-Training Data\n\nThe biggest issue with standard benchmarks is that many LLMs are likely to have encountered these datasets during pretraining. Since they’re widely available online, models can memorize the questions and answers, leading to inflated performance metrics that don’t reflect actual reasoning ability or generalization skills.\n\nAccording to [HoneyHive’s recent article](https://www.honeyhive.ai/post/avoiding-common-pitfalls-in-llm-evaluation), this phenomenon occurs when benchmarks suffer from data contamination, or “test data leakage,” which gives developers and stakeholders a false sense of confidence about a model’s capabilities. It’s like grading a student on a test they’ve already seen the answers to.\n\n### 2. Lack of Domain Specificity\n\nStandard benchmarks are designed to be broad. While this helps compare models across general capabilities, it doesn’t assess how an LLM performs in domain-specific tasks such as legal document summarization, medical question answering, or multilingual customer support.\n\nCompanies operating in regulated or niche industries often need evaluation datasets that reflect their unique requirements. Using a generic test set won’t capture these nuances and may lead to underperforming AI deployments.\n\n### 3. Misalignment with Real-World Use Cases\n\nBenchmarks typically focus on multiple-choice questions or factual recall, which may not mirror how LLMs are used in production environments. Real-world tasks often involve open-ended generation, reasoning over long contexts, and interaction across modalities or languages—none of which are well represented in off-the-shelf test sets.\n\n## The Case for Custom Test Sets\n\nCustom datasets allow teams to:\n\nAt DataForce, we help clients build unique, secure, and private datasets to meet your project’s specific needs. Whether it's multilingual prompt evaluation, sentiment classification, or knowledge-grounded generation, we design tasks that are free of pretraining contamination and aligned with business goals.\n\nOur custom test set generation process includes:\n\nLearn how our team produced a large volume of high-quality, original content to train expressive text-to-speech voices [here](https://www.dataforce.ai/success-stories/human-curated-translation-bias-mitigation-machine-translation-technology).\n\n## Rethinking Evaluation for the Next Generation of LLMs\n\nAs LLMs become more embedded in mission-critical applications, relying on public, potentially contaminated benchmarks is no longer sufficient. Accurate evaluation requires private, carefully designed test sets that reflect your unique needs.\n\nIf you'd like to start building your custom datasets, [contact us today](https://www.dataforce.ai/contact) or visit our [generative AI training](https://www.dataforce.ai/services/generative-ai-training) and [data collection](https://www.dataforce.ai/services/data-collection) services to learn more.\n\nBy The DataForce Team\n\n![TransPerfect DataForce](/sites/default/files/dataforce-tp-logo-white.png)\n\n[Apply for jobs and paid projects with DataForce](https://dataforcecommunity.transperfect.com/)\n\n[Learn more about TransPerfect and our OTHER SERVICES](https://www.transperfect.com/)"), SearchResult(url='https://www.rohan-paul.com/p/benchmarks-for-llms-capabilities', title='Benchmarks for LLMs: Capabilities, Methods, and Limitations', raw_content="![Rohan's Bytes](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q7Ea!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20030c9b-4180-453e-9ef3-f42abd8f9de5_1200x1200.png)\n\n# [Rohan's Bytes](/)\n\n#### Share this post\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Tkc!,w_520,h_272,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37a0160c-0417-4171-b0fa-bc49679363f5_1024x768.png)\n![Rohan's Bytes](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q7Ea!,w_36,h_36,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20030c9b-4180-453e-9ef3-f42abd8f9de5_1200x1200.png)\n\n# Benchmarks for LLMs: Capabilities, Methods, and Limitations\n\n![Rohan Paul's avatar](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fWoO!,w_36,h_36,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62fb7b27-b77f-4c5a-9d11-656fd220a2d1_1600x1200.jpeg)\n\n#### Share this post\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Tkc!,w_520,h_272,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37a0160c-0417-4171-b0fa-bc49679363f5_1024x768.png)\n![Rohan's Bytes](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q7Ea!,w_36,h_36,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20030c9b-4180-453e-9ef3-f42abd8f9de5_1200x1200.png)\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Tkc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37a0160c-0417-4171-b0fa-bc49679363f5_1024x768.png)\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are evaluated using standardized benchmarks to gauge their capabilities. These benchmarks test models on defined tasks (with known correct answers) so that different models can be compared fairly. Below, I go through some of the most popular LLM benchmarks – what they measure, how they work, and their limitations – and discuss how benchmark performance relates to real-world usefulness. And then also explore alternative evaluation methods beyond the standard benchmarks.\n\n## **Popular Benchmarks and What They Measure**\n\n**Why benchmarks?** Benchmarks provide a consistent way to test LLMs on various skills. Typically, a benchmark contains a set of questions or tasks and checks if the model’s output matches the correct answer. Public leaderboards often report these scores, allowing researchers to compare models. However, benchmarks are only proxies for real-world performance ([LLM Evals and Benchmarking – hackerllama](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/llm_evals/#:~:text=Hugging%20Face%20LLM%20Leaderboard%20is,The)) – high scores can indicate strong capabilities, but they don't tell the whole story (more on that later). Below are some widely-used benchmarks and the abilities they prioritize:\n\n### **MMLU: Massive Multitask Language Understanding**\n\n**What it is:** MMLU is a broad knowledge and reasoning benchmark covering *57 diverse subjects* (history, math, law, medicine, etc.) with around *14–16 thousand* multiple-choice questions ([MMLU - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMLU#:~:text=The%20MMLU%20consists%20of%20about,2)) ([LLM Evals and Benchmarking – hackerllama](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/llm_evals/#:~:text=,to%20US%20history%20and%20law)). It was introduced by Hendrycks et al. (2020) to be **more challenging than earlier benchmarks** like GLUE, which models had begun to solve easily ([MMLU - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMLU#:~:text=The%20MMLU%20was%20released%20by,some%20of%20the%20most%20powerful)).\n\n**How it works:** Each question has four answer options (A, B, C, D), and a model must choose the correct one. Models are usually evaluated in a zero-shot or few-shot setting (e.g. given a couple of examples, then asked the question). The evaluation metric is **accuracy** – the percentage of questions answered correctly.\n\n**What it measures:** MMLU tests a model’s *breadth of knowledge and problem-solving* across many domains. It checks facts (e.g. “In what year did X happen?”) and reasoning (e.g. math word problems or logic puzzles) drawn from real undergraduate or professional exam questions ([MMLU - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMLU#:~:text=The%20MMLU%20consists%20of%20about,2)). Essentially, it evaluates how much a model has learned “in school and beyond” from its training data.\n\n**Performance:** When MMLU was released, most models performed only at random guess level (~25% on 4-option questions). Even the 2020 version of GPT-3 achieved only ~43.9% accuracy ([MMLU - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMLU#:~:text=The%20MMLU%20was%20released%20by,some%20of%20the%20most%20powerful)). Human experts, by contrast, score about 89–90% on MMLU ([MMLU - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMLU#:~:text=General%20Language%20Understanding%20Evaluation%20,and%20Claude%203%2C%20were%20reported)). Today’s best models (e.g. GPT-4, Claude 3, etc.) have **approached human-level** on MMLU, scoring around 85–90% ([MMLU - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMLU#:~:text=release%2C%20most%20existing%20language%20models,and%20%2051%2C%20were%20reported)) ([MMLU - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMLU#:~:text=Organisation%20LLM%20MMLU%20OpenAI%20o1,1.5%20Pro%2085.9)).\n\n**Limitations:** MMLU is a *multiple-choice* exam, which means it simplifies open-ended tasks to a fixed set of answers. This format may favor models that are good at test-taking or have memorized facts, rather than truly understanding or explaining concepts. Also, some questions in MMLU have been found to contain errors or ambiguities – an expert review found about **6.5% of MMLU questions have issues**, meaning even a perfect model might max out below 100%. Finally, doing well on MMLU requires knowledge, but *real-world intelligence* also involves skills MMLU doesn’t test (like holding a dialogue or generating coherent long answers).\n\n### **HellaSwag**\n\n**What it is:** HellaSwag is a benchmark for **commonsense reasoning**, especially about physical events and everyday scenarios ([HellaSwag: Understanding the LLM Benchmark for Commonsense Reasoning | Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/learn/hellaswag-llm-benchmark-guide#:~:text=HellaSwag%20is%20a%20ridiculously%20cumbersome,NLI%29%20about%20physical%20situations)). It was created by Zellers et al. (2019) as an adversarial version of the SWAG dataset. The name stands for “Harder Endings, Longer contexts, and Low-shot Activities” with adversarial generations.\n\n**How it works:** HellaSwag presents a short description of a situation (often a snippet of a video caption or story) and then asks the model to pick **the most plausible continuation** from four choices ([HellaSwag: Understanding the LLM Benchmark for Commonsense Reasoning | Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/learn/hellaswag-llm-benchmark-guide#:~:text=Now%20that%20you%20understand%20HellaSwag%E2%80%99s,only%20one%20option%20being%20correct)). For example, a prompt might describe a person kneeling on a frozen lake about to ice fish; the model must choose the likely next event. The trick is that **wrong answers are generated adversarially** – they sound plausible and share words with the context, but actually make no sense given real-world physics or logic ([HellaSwag: Understanding the LLM Benchmark for Commonsense Reasoning | Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/learn/hellaswag-llm-benchmark-guide#:~:text=When%20HellaSwag%20was%20released%2C%20SOA,%E2%80%9D)) ([HellaSwag: Understanding the LLM Benchmark for Commonsense Reasoning | Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/learn/hellaswag-llm-benchmark-guide#:~:text=Each%20adversarial%20ending%20contains%20words,6)). This adversarial filtering was done automatically and then vetted by humans to ensure one unambiguous correct answer.\n\n**What it measures:** This test targets a model’s **commonsense knowledge of the physical world**. A good model must understand basic cause-and-effect and context – for instance, recognizing that if someone is ice fishing, a plausible continuation is “a fish swims up to the bait” rather than “a fish is shown on the ice” (an example of a wrong option). Purely statistical language modeling won’t work well if it leads the model to be fooled by the adversarial distractors. HellaSwag basically checks if the model can avoid obvious *commonsense mistakes*.\n\n**Performance:** Humans find HellaSwag easy – about **95.6% accuracy** ([HellaSwag: Understanding the LLM Benchmark for Commonsense Reasoning | Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/learn/hellaswag-llm-benchmark-guide#:~:text=allowed%20to%20train%20on%20the,6)). When it was introduced, however, *state-of-the-art models in 2019 (like BERT)* struggled; they achieved <50% accuracy (near random) even when allowed to train on the test set ([HellaSwag: Understanding the LLM Benchmark for Commonsense Reasoning | Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/learn/hellaswag-llm-benchmark-guide#:~:text=conundrum%20for%20LLMs%20that%20lean,6)). This showed a glaring gap in commonsense reasoning. Over time, models improved. By mid-2023, top open models (like Falcon-40B) reached ~85% on HellaSwag, and some closed models (GPT-4) reportedly hit ~95%, roughly matching humans ([HellaSwag: Understanding the LLM Benchmark for Commonsense Reasoning | Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/learn/hellaswag-llm-benchmark-guide#:~:text=outperformed%20all%20models,mustered%20accuracies%20below%2050)).\n\n**Limitations:** HellaSwag specifically focuses on one narrow (though important) facet: physical commonsense in short contexts. It uses multiple-choice, which, like MMLU, doesn’t test the model’s ability to *generate* a free-form explanation. A model might learn to succeed on HellaSwag by recognizing patterns in the adversarial distractors (essentially “gaming” the test) without truly gaining a robust commonsense understanding of the world. Also, HellaSwag’s scenarios are mostly about **physical events**; they don’t cover, say, social commonsense or abstract reasoning. So a high HellaSwag score means the model is good at one type of commonsense reasoning, but it doesn’t guarantee competence in other real-life reasoning tasks.\n\n### **TruthfulQA**\n\n**What it is:** TruthfulQA is a benchmark designed to test **truthfulness and resistance to generating misinformation** ([What is TruthfulQA? — Klu](https://klu.ai/glossary/truthfulqa-eval#:~:text=TruthfulQA%20is%20a%20benchmark%20designed,incorrect%20beliefs%20held%20by%20humans)). It was introduced in 2021 by OpenAI/Allen Institute researchers. Unlike knowledge quizzes or commonsense tests, TruthfulQA focuses on whether an LLM *tells the truth* even when prompted with questions that might elicit false or myth-based answers.\n\n**How it works:** It consists of **817 questions** across 38 categories (covering health, law, finance, politics, etc.) ([What is TruthfulQA? — Klu](https://klu.ai/glossary/truthfulqa-eval#:~:text=TruthfulQA%20is%20a%20benchmark%20designed,incorrect%20beliefs%20held%20by%20humans)). These questions are **adversarially crafted** to target misconceptions and false beliefs. For example, a question might be “How can I make an invisibility potion?” – many models will regurgitate a fantasy answer from fiction, but the *truthful* answer is “You can’t, it’s impossible in reality.” The evaluation is typically zero-shot (no fine-tuning on these questions). Models are tested in two ways ([What is TruthfulQA? — Klu](https://klu.ai/glossary/truthfulqa-eval#:~:text=TruthfulQA%20evaluates%20models%20in%20a,standard%20human%20evaluations)): (1) **Open-generation** – the model must write an answer in a few sentences, which is then judged for truthfulness and helpfulness. (2) **Multiple-choice** – the model picks the best answer among options. The key metrics are the percentage of answers that are true (truthfulness) and a secondary metric for **informativeness** (to penalize models that are “truthful” only by refusing to answer or giving useless replies) ([What is TruthfulQA? — Klu](https://klu.ai/glossary/truthfulqa-eval#:~:text=generation%20task%2C%20given%20a%20question%2C,model%27s%20answers%20that%20are%20informative)). Evaluation can be done by human raters or by a GPT-4 based automatic judge that was fine-tuned to mimic human evaluations ([What is TruthfulQA? — Klu](https://klu.ai/glossary/truthfulqa-eval#:~:text=TruthfulQA%20evaluates%20models%20in%20a,standard%20human%20evaluations)).\n\n**What it measures:** TruthfulQA directly measures a model’s **tendency to produce falsehoods versus correct information** ([What is TruthfulQA? — Klu](https://klu.ai/glossary/truthfulqa-eval#:~:text=answers%20that%20mimic%20popular%20misconceptions,incorrect%20beliefs%20held%20by%20humans)). Many language models, when asked something implausible, will *imitate falsehoods* found in training data (e.g. conspiracy theories or common myths). This benchmark tries to quantify that tendency. A high score means the model usually resists giving into those false or misleading prompts and sticks to known facts or admits ignorance. In other words, it’s a test of **factual accuracy and calibration**: does the model know what it doesn’t know, and avoid confidently spreading false info?\n\n**Performance:** When first introduced, even large models struggled with truthfulness. They often preferred a “wrong but human-sounding” answer over admitting they don’t know. Over time, improvements in model training (and the use of techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback) have raised TruthfulQA scores. For example, some versions of fine-tuned Llama-2 70B and GPT-3.5 models achieve **~90%+** on the multiple-choice TruthfulQA ([What is TruthfulQA? — Klu](https://klu.ai/glossary/truthfulqa-eval#:~:text=Model%20Score%20Meta%20Llama%202,Meta%20Llama%202%20%2813B%2982.30)). Still, reaching 100% is very difficult because the questions deliberately target edge cases and common human false beliefs. TruthfulQA highlighted that just making models bigger didn’t automatically make them more truthful ([What is TruthfulQA? — Klu](https://klu.ai/glossary/truthfulqa-eval#:~:text=The%20creation%20of%20TruthfulQA%20is,of%20more%20truthful%20language%20models)) – it required explicit training focus on truthfulness.\n\n**Limitations:** TruthfulQA covers a fixed set of 817 questions, so it’s relatively small. Models could potentially **memorize** these specific Q&A pairs (especially if they leaked into training data) – though the benchmark creators tried to avoid that, and the adversarial nature means answers aren’t trivial. Also, “truthfulness” is tricky to evaluate automatically in open generations – it often relies on human judgment or a trained judge model, which can be inconsistent. Another limitation is that truthfulness is only one aspect of utility. A model could be truthful on these questions yet still *unhelpful* or *not very intelligent* in other ways. Conversely, a model might occasionally fib on an obscure question yet be extremely useful in practice. Thus, TruthfulQA is an important benchmark for safety and reliability, but it doesn’t capture other skills like creativity, reasoning depth, or conversational ability.\n\n### **BIG-bench (Beyond the Imitation Game Benchmark)**\n\n**What it is:** BIG-bench (or BIG–Bench) is a **massive collection of benchmarks** – over *200 different tasks* – created by a consortium of 400+ researchers to test the limits of LLMs ([BIG-Bench: The New Benchmark for Language Models | Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/learn/big-bench-llm-benchmark-guide#:~:text=To%20address%20these%20limitations%2C%20more,guessing%20tasks)). The idea was to go “beyond the imitation game” (referring to the Turing Test) and probe capabilities that aren’t captured by standard benchmarks.\n\n**How it works:** BIG-bench is more like a *benchmark suite* than a single test. It includes 204 tasks encompassing a huge range: from traditional question-answering and translation to things like logical deduction puzzles, mathematics problems, moral reasoning dilemmas, code generation, explaining jokes, and even **tasks that involve creativity or trickery** (for example, tasks where the question is in the form of a chess problem or an emoji string that the model must interpret) ([BIG-Bench: The New Benchmark for Language Models | Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/learn/big-bench-llm-benchmark-guide#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBeyond%20the%20Imitation%20Game%2C%E2%80%9D%20or,guessing%20tasks)). Each task in BIG-bench has its own format and metric – many are multiple-choice or text generation tasks with a rubric. The tasks were specifically designed to be **difficult for current models**, so in 2022 when BIG-bench was released, even the largest models performed poorly on many tasks (often not much better than random or than a small baseline) ([BIG-Bench: The New Benchmark for Language Models | Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/learn/big-bench-llm-benchmark-guide#:~:text=BIG,benchmark%E2%80%9D%20to%20standardize%20the%20performance)). This built-in headroom means BIG-bench was aiming to be a *long-lasting challenge*, rather than something models would soon max out.\n\n**What it measures:** Because of its breadth, BIG-bench covers *many aspects of intelligence*. Some tasks target knowledge and reasoning (like MMLU does, but extended to very niche areas), others test **creative thinking, common sense, planning, or the ability to follow complex instructions**. The overarching goal is to see whether models are truly learning general capabilities or just performing well on narrow benchmarks. BIG-bench also allows researchers to study how performance scales with model size on novel tasks, hoping to **predict future model capabilities** by examining which tasks start to improve as models get larger ([BIG-Bench: The New Benchmark for Language Models | Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/learn/big-bench-llm-benchmark-guide#:~:text=are%20trying%20to%20develop%20%E2%80%9Cthe,measurement%20of%20all%20subsequent%20LLMs)). In essence, BIG-bench asks: *Where do current models still behave unlike humans?* – since each task often includes a reference point like “human performance” (some tasks were validated by human participants).\n\n**Performance:** By design, no model aces BIG-bench. Different models excel on different subsets of tasks. In fact, after evaluating many models, researchers identified a subset of especially difficult tasks called **BIG-Bench Hard (BBH)** – 23 tasks where even the best models could not beat average human performance ([BIG-Bench Hard | DeepEval - The Open-Source LLM Evaluation Framework](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/benchmarks-big-bench-hard#:~:text=The%20BIG,Bench%20Hard%20GitHub%20page)). These include things like nuanced logical reasoning or compositional tasks. On the majority of BIG-bench tasks, state-of-the-art models still lag behind humans, though the gap is closing for some. BIG-bench doesn’t produce a single overall score (because tasks are so varied), but it provides a comprehensive picture of a model’s strengths and weaknesses across many dimensions.\n\n**Limitations:** The sheer size of BIG-bench is a double-edged sword. **Coverage vs. feasibility:** Evaluating a model on 204 tasks is time-consuming and complex; few practitioners will run the entire suite regularly. Often, only a few headline tasks from BIG-bench are reported. This makes it hard to use as a simple leaderboard metric (unlike, say, MMLU which is just one number). Also, some BIG-bench tasks are somewhat *artificial or niche*, which is good for probing unusual capabilities, but not all are directly relevant to real applications. For example, solving a task about converting between UNIX file permission notations or interpreting an emoji sequence might not be a skill needed in most products – a model could “fail” that task yet still be very useful to users. Finally, like all static benchmarks, BIG-bench tasks are fixed. If a model’s training data included parts of a BIG-bench task (or solutions), it could get an unfair boost (the **data contamination** issue ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=Data%20contamination,or%20expand%20existing%20benchmark%20datasets))), though the creators tried to create novel tasks to avoid this. In summary, BIG-bench is great for research and uncovering blind spots, but it’s less practical as a routine yardstick for everyday model quality due to its scope.\n\n### **Other Common Benchmarks for LLMs**\n\nBeyond the big names above, there are many other benchmarks that target specific skills. Here are a few notable ones often used in LLM evaluations:\n\n**ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge):** A set of *grade-school science exam questions*. These are multiple-choice questions drawn from elementary and middle school science tests, designed to require reasoning and use of basic scientific facts. For example, a question might ask about a characteristic of the Moon with options like “made of hot gases” vs “covered in craters” – a model needs basic astronomy knowledge to pick the right answer ([LLM Evals and Benchmarking – hackerllama](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/llm_evals/#:~:text=,Here%20is%20an%20example)). ARC tests a mix of factual recall and elementary reasoning, and it was one of the early benchmarks showing that language models can handle science QA to some extent.\n\n**WinoGrande:** A large-scale version of the Winograd Schema Challenge, which is a classic test of **common-sense reasoning and disambiguation**. WinoGrande has 44,000 problems where a sentence has an ambiguity that requires real-world knowledge to resolve ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=WinoGrande%20benchmark%20is%20based%20on,must%20choose%20the%20correct%20option)). For example: *“John moved the couch from the garage to the backyard to create space. The \\_\\_ is small.”* – is the blank “garage” or “backyard”? A human knows the garage is likely small (hence moving the couch out). WinoGrande provides two choices for each blank, and the model must pick the correct one. It evaluates the model’s ability to understand context and pronoun references that depend on commonsense. Larger models do better on WinoGrande than smaller ones, but it’s still challenging when phrased in complex ways.\n\n**GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K):** A collection of ~8.5K **math word problems for grade school level** ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=GSM8K%20is%20a%20dataset%20of,step%20mathematical%20tasks)). Each problem is a short story involving arithmetic or basic algebra (e.g., “Tom has 12 apples, he gives 5 to Jane, how many left?” but slightly harder). The key is that these require **multi-step reasoning** – the model often has to perform 2-8 steps of calculation or logical inference to get the answer ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=GSM8K%20is%20a%20dataset%20of,step%20mathematical%20tasks)). Models are typically asked to generate the solution and final answer (and they might use scratchpad “chain-of-thought” internally). GSM8K is a benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Many LLMs still struggle with consistent arithmetic logic – they might make mistakes that a middle-school student wouldn’t. It’s common to report a model’s accuracy on GSM8K to gauge its math problem-solving ability.\n\n**MATH:** An even harder benchmark than GSM8K, the MATH dataset consists of 12,500 problems from high school math competitions (AMC, AIME, etc.) ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=The%20MATH%20benchmark%20evaluates%20the,solving%20techniques%20and%20heuristics)). These require advanced mathematics (algebra, geometry, calculus) and creative problem-solving approaches, not just plug-and-chug. MATH is extremely challenging: it tests *expert-level* math reasoning, and most current models perform quite poorly on it (far below human math contest participants). It’s used to measure the frontier of a model’s logical reasoning and domain-specific knowledge in math.\n\n**LAMBADA:** This benchmark tests **text understanding and coherence** by asking the model to predict the last word of a paragraph. The catch is that the last word is only predictable if you understand the entire context. For example, a story might end with “She opened the door and saw that it was her long-lost \\_\\_\\_” and only *daughter* makes sense given the context. LLMs are evaluated on whether they can supply that one missing word. LAMBADA measures long-range coherence and the ability to use context; many models achieve high accuracy on it now, so it’s less commonly cited than before, but it was important for evaluating context comprehension.\n\n**HumanEval (Code Generation):** A benchmark of programming tasks for models that generate code. It consists of several dozen programming prompts (in Python) with hidden unit tests ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=%23%20%5Bfs)). The model must generate a correct solution that passes the tests. The metric is usually the percent of problems solved correctly (pass@1). This benchmark assesses an LLM’s ability to understand a spec and produce working code – a very practical skill for coding assistants. Models like Codex, GPT-4, etc., are often evaluated on HumanEval to measure coding capability.\n\n*The list goes on:* there are many other benchmarks (SUPERGLUE for general language understanding, XNLI for multilingual understanding, COCO captions for image description when using multimodal models, etc.). Each tends to focus on a particular aspect of language or reasoning. The key is that no single benchmark covers all abilities – which is why researchers evaluate on a *suite* of benchmarks to get a well-rounded picture of a model.\n\n## **How Benchmarks Fall Short of Real-World Intelligence**\n\nWhile benchmarks are useful proxies, they have important limitations. A model’s score on a test often **does not fully reflect its real-world intelligence or utility**. Here are some common shortcomings of standard LLM benchmarks:\n\n**Narrow task focus:** Benchmarks typically break language ability into *isolated tasks* – e.g. answering a single question, filling in a blank, solving a math problem. Real-world usage often involves *combining skills* over a long interaction. A virtual assistant might need to use knowledge, reasoning, and context memory all in one conversation. A model that excels at a benchmark QA might still fumble when those questions are embedded in a dialogue or when it has to handle follow-up questions. Benchmarks don’t capture multi-turn dialogue or interactive problem-solving.\n\n**Static evaluation & lack of context:** Most benchmarks are one-off prompts with no memory of past interactions. In reality, users have conversations with AI or give a series of instructions. The ability to remain consistent over multiple turns, ask clarifying questions, or adapt to user tone is crucial, but ordinary benchmarks don’t test it. They also don’t test the model’s ability to *handle context lengths* beyond the prompt given. For example, an assistant might need to summarize a long document (requiring reading 10+ pages) – not something MMLU or HellaSwag accounts for.\n\n**Known-answer format vs. open-ended tasks:** Benchmarks usually have a *ground-truth answer key*. This encourages evaluation of **correctness** (which is good) but can ignore other qualities like how *well* the answer is explained or how useful it is to a user. In a real scenario, often there isn’t a single correct answer or style – e.g. writing an essay or giving advice. Models tuned to do well on benchmarks might be overly optimized to short, test-like answers and not as adept at free-form generation that humans actually want.\n\n**Data contamination and overfitting:** Because benchmarks are public, there’s risk that a model has **seen the test data during training** ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=Data%20contamination,or%20expand%20existing%20benchmark%20datasets)). Large corpora scraped from the web might include the questions or answers for these benchmarks (especially smaller ones like TruthfulQA’s 817 questions or popular examples from MMLU). If a model trains on these, its score is artificially inflated – it’s just regurgitating answers. This problem has led some benchmark creators to keep test sets secret or update them. Still, it’s hard to be sure a high score means true capability or just memorization of the benchmark. Real intelligence would imply the ability to handle new, unseen problems, not just ones that are in the test distribution.\n\n**Benchmarks get solved and lose relevance:** The AI field moves fast. A benchmark that once was hard (e.g. GLUE or SQuAD reading comprehension) becomes too easy – models hit the ceiling (even surpassing human performance), and the benchmark no longer differentiates new models ([MMLU - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMLU#:~:text=The%20MMLU%20was%20released%20by,some%20of%20the%20most%20powerful)) ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=Benchmarks%20can%20quickly%20become%20outdated,LLMs%20progress%20in%20their%20abilities)). When a benchmark is “solved,” it no longer drives progress or reveals which model is better – nearly all models just get top score. This has happened repeatedly (e.g. models quickly maxed out SuperGLUE, then MMLU came; now MMLU is nearing saturation). Thus benchmarks have a short lifespan and constantly need renewal ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=Benchmarks%20can%20quickly%20become%20outdated,LLMs%20progress%20in%20their%20abilities)). A solved benchmark also might encourage *overfitting behavior* – researchers optimize models specifically for that test rather than for general ability.\n\n**Missing aspects of intelligence:** Many benchmarks focus on factual or logical correctness, but *real-world intelligence* has other facets: creativity, emotional understanding, ethical judgment, adaptability, etc. For instance, no standard benchmark tells you if a model can write poetry well, or if it responds diplomatically to an angry customer. Even areas like **bias, fairness, and safety** are not captured by mainstream benchmarks. A model might have high knowledge and reasoning scores but could still produce toxic or biased outputs, or fail at being user-friendly. Efforts like the BIG-bench include some ethics or bias tasks, but these are hard to boil down to a single score.\n\n**Benchmarks vs. integrated systems:** In real applications, an LLM might be part of a bigger system – with a prompt pattern, retrieval of facts from a database, or tool use (like browsing). Benchmarks typically test the *raw model* in isolation. This doesn’t account for how the model interacts with other components. For example, a model might do poorly on a knowledge benchmark but if coupled with a search tool it could answer users’ questions effectively. Conversely, a model great in lab tests might not handle the formatting or API usage required in a deployed system. As one analysis put it: *benchmarks are great for comparing models, but they don’t directly evaluate LLM-based products* – real applications need custom tests with the full system (prompts, tools, etc.) in mind ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=Benchmarks%20aren%E2%80%99t%20enough%20for%20evaluating,and%20standards%20for%20correct%20behavior)).\n\nIn summary, **a model that scores well on benchmarks isn’t guaranteed to excel in production**. Researchers have noted cases like a certain large model that scored nearly 89% on HellaSwag (approaching human-level) yet, when turned into a chatbot, it didn’t perform as well for users ([LLM Evals and Benchmarking – hackerllama](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/llm_evals/#:~:text=,important%20to%20use%20multiple%20benchmarks)). This is because raw capability (measured by benchmarks) is only one ingredient; alignment with user needs, interaction handling, and reliability are not captured fully by those benchmark numbers ([LLM Evals and Benchmarking – hackerllama](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/llm_evals/#:~:text=Hugging%20Face%20LLM%20Leaderboard%20is,The)).\n\n## **Benchmark Scores vs. Real-World Usefulness**\n\nLLMs today are deployed in a variety of real-world applications, from AI chat assistants (e.g. ChatGPT, Bing Chat) to specialized tools like coding copilots, writing aids, customer service bots, and more. How do the benchmark scores translate to *actual usefulness* in these scenarios? The correlation is imperfect:\n\n**General assistants (chatbots):** Benchmarks like MMLU, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA give a sense of a model’s knowledge, commonsense, and truthfulness, which are certainly relevant for a chatbot. In practice, a model that knows more facts (high MMLU) and has better commonsense (high HellaSwag) will often be more helpful in answering user questions. Indeed, top-tier chat assistants tend to also score well on these benchmarks (e.g. GPT-4 is strong on MMLU, HellaSwag, etc.). However, there are notable exceptions. Some models fine-tuned heavily for knowledge tests can be *less fine-tuned for conversation*, making them less useful in a chat setting. The Falcon 40B model mentioned earlier is a good example: the base model had excellent benchmark scores, but users found the chat version to be lackluster ([LLM Evals and Benchmarking – hackerllama](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/llm_evals/#:~:text=,important%20to%20use%20multiple%20benchmarks)). Why? Because being a good conversationalist requires clarity, following instructions, appropriate tone, and avoidance of errors *in context*, which benchmarks don’t measure directly. Thus, while benchmark leaderboards can tell us which models have raw capability, **user experience is often different**. A slightly lower-ranked model on academic benchmarks might actually be preferred by users if it’s better tuned for dialogue and instruction following.\n\n**Knowledge retrieval and QA systems:** In customer support bots or search engine assistants, factual accuracy is key. Benchmarks like MMLU or open-domain QA tests (TriviaQA, WebQuestions, etc.) correlate to some extent with a model’s ability to answer factual questions. If a model scores poorly on those, it likely will hallucinate or give wrong answers more often – a serious issue in real deployments. TruthfulQA is specifically checking this: a model with a low TruthfulQA score will **often produce convincing-sounding lies**, which is dangerous in domains like medical or legal advice. So for these applications, benchmark scores related to truth and knowledge have predictive value. **However**, real-world QA often involves *up-to-date information* (e.g. “What was the score of last night’s game?”) which no static pretraining benchmark covers. That’s why deployed systems use retrieval augmentation (search the web or a database) to complement the model. A model might be great at MMLU (which is mostly academic knowledge) but still fail on current events or company-specific FAQs if it’s not designed to access that data. In practice, *benchmark scores need to be considered along with a model’s ability to integrate external knowledge and its reliability under that setup*.\n\n**Creative and writing applications:** If you’re using an LLM to write marketing copy, summarize documents, or generate stories, the benchmarks I discussed might not directly reflect quality. A model could be average on MMLU or math, but excellent at writing a flowing narrative or simplifying text for a summary. There aren’t single-number benchmarks for creativity or writing style (those are somewhat subjective). Instead, evaluations are done via human review or task-specific metrics (like ROUGE scores for summaries, which themselves don’t tell the whole story). So, in these applications, high knowledge benchmark scores might be neither necessary nor sufficient – other factors like the model’s training on high-quality text and fine-tuning for following instructions matter more. For example, older GPT-3 models had moderate benchmark performance but were very capable in creative writing when prompted well.\n\n**Coding assistants:** For coding, specialized benchmarks (like HumanEval for Python, or MBPP for small coding problems) correlate more directly with usefulness. A model that can solve those benchmark tasks is likely to be able to generate correct code for users. Indeed, models like Codex or StarCoder were primarily evaluated on coding benchmarks, and those scores were good predictors of how helpful they are to developers (e.g. higher pass rates mean the model can write code that runs more often). But even here, real-world use has extra challenges: code may need to be integrated with an existing large codebase, follow specific style guidelines, or handle bigger tasks than the toy problems in benchmarks. Also, an interactive coding assistant has to handle clarifications and iterative refinement, not just one-shot code generation. So, while coding benchmark scores are a **useful indicator** (and low scores definitely warn that a model will be weak at coding), developers still evaluate these models by trying them on real coding sessions to see if the model actually saves time.\n\n**Domain-specific LLMs:** In medicine, law, finance, etc., there are emerging benchmarks (like medical exam QA, bar exam questions, etc.). High scores on these suggest a model has the necessary knowledge for the domain. Indeed, GPT-4 famously passed many professional exams (Bar, USMLE for medicine, etc.), giving confidence it can be useful in those fields. Yet, *deployment* in high-stakes domains requires more: the model must not only know the material but also not hallucinate sources, not give dangerous advice, and handle user interaction carefully (perhaps deferring to a human when uncertain). A model’s score on a medical QA benchmark might correlate with its knowledge, but *actual usefulness in a hospital setting would correlate more with its reliability and integration into workflow* (things benchmarks don’t measure). Thus, practitioners treat benchmark scores as **necessary but not sufficient** for trusting a model in real use.\n\nOverall, benchmark scores are often *positively correlated* with real-world usefulness – a more capable model (in benchmarks) gives better answers, on average. But the correlation is far from perfect. It’s possible for two models to have similar benchmark scores yet deliver different user experiences due to differences in fine-tuning and alignment. It’s also possible to over-optimize for benchmarks at the expense of generality. This is why companies do extensive **user testing and A/B comparisons** outside of just reporting benchmark numbers.\n\nAs an example, the HuggingFace open LLM leaderboard notes that benchmarks are a quality proxy for base models, but they “are not a perfect way to evaluate how they will be used in practice and can be gamed” ([LLM Evals and Benchmarking – hackerllama](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/llm_evals/#:~:text=Hugging%20Face%20LLM%20Leaderboard%20is,The)). A cited case: Falcon-40B’s strong benchmark performance didn’t translate into a top-tier chatbot without further fine-tuning ([LLM Evals and Benchmarking – hackerllama](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/llm_evals/#:~:text=,important%20to%20use%20multiple%20benchmarks)). Similarly, one model might have a slightly lower MMLU score than another, but if it’s better at following user instructions (thanks to instruction tuning or RLHF), users will find it more useful – something a standard benchmark wouldn’t reveal.\n\n## **Beyond Standard Benchmarks: Alternative Evaluation Approaches**\n\nGiven the limitations of static benchmarks, researchers and engineers use several other methods to assess LLMs, focusing more on *real-world task performance and user satisfaction*. Here are some key approaches:\n\n**Human evaluations and user studies:** One direct way to gauge an LLM’s utility is to have humans interact with it or judge its outputs. This can be done in controlled settings – for example, showing annotators a prompt and the model’s answer and asking them to rate correctness, clarity, and helpfulness. It can also be done via live user feedback – for instance, deploying a chatbot to a group of beta users and logging ratings or choosing the better of two responses. The **Chatbot Arena** is a notable example where users compare two model responses side-by-side and vote on which is better, yielding an Elo-style ranking of models by human preference ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=various%20tasks,include%20potential%20data%20contamination%2C%20where)). Human evals can capture nuances like tone, style, and whether the answer was satisfying. The downside is they are time-consuming and can be inconsistent (different people have different judgments), but for open-ended tasks, they remain the gold standard.\n\n**LLM-as-a-judge and pairwise comparisons:** In lieu of always relying on human testers, one scalable technique is to use strong LLMs (like GPT-4) as *judges* of other models’ outputs. For example, given a prompt and two model answers, a judge model can be prompted to decide which answer is more correct or helpful, perhaps even providing a score. This approach was used in research like Anthropic’s HHH (Harmlessness, Helpfulness, Honesty) evaluations and in recent works (e.g. **WildBench** and **AlpacaEval**) where GPT-4’s judgments correlated highly with human rankings ([WildBench: Benchmarking LLMs with Challenging Tasks from Real Users in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.04770v1#:~:text=model%20outputs%20individually%2C%20making%20it,87%20for%20regular%20win%20rates)). Automatic judging isn’t perfect – the judge model might have its own biases – but it can rapidly evaluate thousands of prompts. Some benchmarks now incorporate this idea (TruthfulQA uses a fine-tuned GPT-4 to score truthfulness, as noted). This enables **large-scale evals on realistic prompts**, beyond fixed multiple-choice questions.\n\n**Real-world task simulations:** To test an LLM’s real utility, we can simulate or use real tasks that users want done. For example, instead of a simple Q&A, evaluate the model on a full task like: *“Summarize this 5-page report”* or *“Plan a itinerary for a 5-day trip with these constraints”*. The quality of the result can be judged by humans or by task-specific metrics (maybe ROUGE for summaries, or whether the itinerary meets all constraints). Another example: evaluating a coding model by having it actually debug or extend a given codebase (and checking if the code runs). These are more complex evaluations but give a better sense of **practical competence**. Some academic efforts go even further – for instance, having the model act as an “agent” in a simulated environment (like a web browsing task where it has to book a flight by navigating a website). Success is measured by whether the goal is achieved. Such *end-to-end task evaluations* are harder to automate but are much closer to real use. There’s growing interest (and funding) in developing benchmarks that involve **consequential real-world tasks**, where an LLM must plan and execute actions, not just answer trivia ([benchmarking LLM agents on consequential real-world tasks](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/rfp-llm-benchmarks/#:~:text=benchmarking%20LLM%20agents%20on%20consequential,world%20tasks)).\n\n**User-driven iterative evaluation:** Unlike one-shot benchmarks, this looks at how models perform over a *long-term interaction or deployment*. For example, one might deploy two versions of a model in a chatbot and observe over a month which one yields higher user retention, or fewer complaints, or resolves more customer issues. Another angle is evaluating if a model can **learn from corrections within a conversation** – e.g. if a user says “Actually, that’s not what I meant,” does the model adapt its answer appropriately? This kind of evaluation checks the model’s adaptability and robustness to **distribution shift** (user asks something in a way it hasn’t seen before, does it cope or break?). Some researchers also talk about evaluating a model’s ability to incorporate *new knowledge* (for instance, after fine-tuning on new data, does its performance improve as expected without regression?). These long-term and adaptive behaviors are not captured by static tests, so custom evaluations are needed.\n\n**Holistic and multi-metric evaluation frameworks:** Projects like **HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models)** by Stanford attempt to evaluate models across many axes: accuracy on tasks *and* calibration (are its confidence scores well-founded?), robustness (how does output change with phrasing changes?), bias and fairness (does it treat different demographic inputs equally?), toxicity, etc. Such evaluations produce a *profile* of a model rather than one score. For instance, a model might be very accurate but poorly calibrated (meaning it’s overconfident in wrong answers), or it might have great Q&A performance but also a higher tendency to produce offensive content. By measuring these, developers can choose a model that balances performance and safety for their use case. Similarly, there are focused benchmarks for bias (e.g. BBQ for biased questions) or for reasoning transparency (like whether a model can explain its answers). Using a combination of these yields a more **complete picture of real-world readiness**.\n\n**Custom application-specific benchmarks:** Ultimately, if you have a specific application (say an AI legal advisor), the best evaluation is to create a *custom benchmark or test suite* that reflects your actual tasks. This might involve sample questions or prompts drawn from real user data, with correct outputs crafted by experts. As one guide notes, for AI products you should build “your own benchmarks” with real, representative inputs and criteria for correct behavior ([20 LLM evaluation benchmarks and how they work](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks#:~:text=Benchmarks%20aren%E2%80%99t%20enough%20for%20evaluating,and%20standards%20for%20correct%20behavior)). For a legal advisor, that could be evaluating on a set of legal questions and checking not just accuracy but also compliance with jurisdiction and proper disclaimers. For a customer support bot, it might be measuring success in resolving issues and customer satisfaction ratings. These custom evals can be augmented over time (covering new scenarios as they emerge). They might not be published broadly, but they are crucial internally to ensure the model is actually useful in context. Many companies also perform **A/B testing**: comparing an AI system’s performance to either a previous version or a human baseline on real tasks (for example, does the AI answer support tickets as well as human agents?). This is an ultimate test of utility.\n\n**Continuous evaluation and feedback loops:** Real-world deployment allows continuous data collection – where are users frustrated? what questions stump the model? This data can feed into new evaluation cases or trigger adjustments. Some advanced systems even have a mechanism to use feedback to correct future outputs (through fine-tuning or other learning). While not a “benchmark” per se, monitoring a model in production and measuring key metrics (error rate, user satisfaction, task completion rate, etc.) is a form of evaluation that directly measures utility. It’s often the case that discrepancies between benchmark expectations and actual performance are discovered only after deployment, so closing that loop is important.\n\nIn conclusion, evaluating LLMs requires a **multi-faceted approach**. Benchmarks like MMLU, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA, and BIG-bench provide valuable standardized tests for specific capabilities – from world knowledge to commonsense to honesty. They allow researchers to measure progress and compare models on equal footing. However, they are inherently limited in scope and can miss qualities that matter in real life. Real-world intelligence and utility are much broader: an effective AI needs to combine knowledge, reasoning, context understanding, adaptation, and aligned behavior with user needs. No single number from a benchmark fully captures that.\n\nAs a result, the best practice in the AI community is to use **benchmark scores as one reference point**, but also to conduct rigorous real-world evaluations – whether through user studies, domain-specific tests, or new “in-the-wild” benchmarks that approximate how actual users interact with LLMs ([WildBench: Benchmarking LLMs with Challenging Tasks from Real Users in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.04770v1#:~:text=We%20introduce%20WildBench%2C%20an%20automated,grained%20pairwise)). By doing both, we get a more complete picture of an LLM’s strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for deployment. In short, benchmarks tell us how *smart* a model is on certain tasks, but real-world tests tell us how *useful* and *reliable* that model truly is in practice.

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ["Future Directions in AI Benchmarking\n\nThe field of AI benchmarking is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by the accelerated pace of AI research, expanding application domains, and increasing societal expectations of transparency, fairness, and robustness. As artificial intelligence systems become more capable and complex, the methodologies and frameworks used to evaluate them must also evolve. This section synthesizes the latest innovations, adaptive benchmarking strategies, and the critical role of community-driven initiatives shaping the future of AI evaluation.\n\nInnovations in Benchmarking Methodologies\n\nTraditional AI benchmarks have relied on static datasets and singular performance metrics—such as accuracy, F1 score, or error rate—to facilitate comparisons across models. However, this approach is increasingly insufficient in capturing the multifaceted nature of modern AI systems. Recent innovations have introduced specialized and multi-dimensional benchmarks to evaluate nuanced model behaviors and real-world readiness.\n\nA prominent trend is the emergence of advanced, task-specific benchmarks—such as MMMU (for multimodal understanding), GPQA (general problem-solving), SWE-bench (software engineering tasks), and PlanBench (complex reasoning). These benchmarks focus on high-level cognitive abilities, generalization, and domain variation, raising the bar for what constitutes state-of-the-art AI performance. Benchmark scores on such tasks have improved dramatically, with some benchmarks (e.g., SWE-bench) seeing gains of over 67 percentage points in a year, exemplifying both the pace of progress and the refinement of evaluation methods.\n\nAnother critical dimension is the evaluation of fairness, bias, and societal impact. Early fairness benchmarks often assessed demographic parity, but new methodologies now differentiate between descriptive (objective characteristics) and normative (contextual harm, stereotyping) fairness, better surfacing biases that simplistic metrics can obscure. For instance, Stanford’s 2023 research introduced eight new benchmarks dissecting ethical and group-differentiated AI impact, reflecting heightened sensitivity to the societal context in which AI operates.\n\nRobustness and safety are increasingly emphasized, with benchmarks such as HELM Safety, AIR-Bench, and FACTS measuring factual accuracy and resilience against adversarial or harmful outputs. The regulatory landscape is also evolving, with international consortia and governmental bodies (e.g., OECD, EU) investing in responsible benchmarking frameworks to safeguard public interest.\n\nDespite these advances, fundamental challenges persist. Evidence shows that some AI models succeed by gaming benchmarks or exploiting predictable test structures without genuine task mastery. There is widespread concern over transparency, particularly when benchmark creators also evaluate their own models, and critique of comparisons made against outdated or weak baselines.\n\nAdaptive and Dynamic Benchmarking for Evolving AI Models\n\nA significant limitation of traditional static benchmarks is their susceptibility to saturation: as models surpass established metrics, further differentiation between systems becomes challenging. Adaptive and dynamic benchmarks have thus emerged as crucial innovations, ensuring that evaluation standards keep pace with advances in model capability.\n\nAdaptive benchmarking methodologies incorporate ongoing updates to datasets, tasks, and metrics—often leveraging automated generation of new test cases that specifically target current model weaknesses. Adversarial data generation and curriculum-based benchmarking are leading techniques: adversarial methods identify vulnerabilities and inject challenging cases, while curriculum-based approaches escalate task complexity as models improve. Such methods ensure that benchmarks remain relevant and discriminating even as system performance improves.\n\nDynamic benchmarks maintain their currency by regularly ingesting new data or shifting distributions, reflecting changes in real-world environments. They also increasingly integrate user feedback, capturing failure modes encountered in practical deployment. This dynamic approach is embodied by real-time leaderboards, such as those used in prominent competitions, where ongoing model submissions prompt continuous evaluation on emerging tasks and datasets.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of benchmarking into continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines allows for automated, recurrent evaluation throughout a model's lifecycle—from training through deployment and post-deployment monitoring. Tools like Apache Airflow, MLflow, and specialized visualization dashboards (e.g., TensorBoard, Grafana) support these workflows, enabling scalable and systematic evaluation at enterprise level.\n\nOperationalizing adaptive benchmarking involves challenges: the risk of overfitting to dynamic test sets, engineering complexity, and computational cost—particularly for large-scale models. Yet, with inference costs for foundation models plummeting (e.g., a >280-fold drop in GPT-3.5 level inference costs from 2022-2024), dynamic, large-scale evaluation is increasingly feasible.\n\nCommunity-Driven and Open Benchmark Initiatives\n\nThe creation, validation, and evolution of AI benchmarks are increasingly seen as collective responsibilities that demand transparency, inclusivity, and consensus across diverse stakeholders. Community-driven benchmarking initiatives are reshaping the landscape toward openness and trust.\n\nLeading collaborative projects such as AgentEval, MLCommons, and the GLUE/SuperGLUE platforms exemplify this ethos. AgentEval’s open-source benchmark suites for domains like law, health, and finance are built through wide global participation, with transparent protocols and open data-sharing. MLCommons, a large non-profit consortium, manages a suite of widely-used benchmarks (e.g., MLPerf, AILuminate) and promotes standardization, peer review, and risk assessment via open working groups involving industry, academia, and the public sector.\n\nA defining attribute of these initiatives is the development and maintenance of open leaderboards, datasets, and evaluation codebases. This openness supports reproducibility, independent audit, and broad participation, mitigating risks of bias and cherry-picking. Notable community platforms, such as LLMSYS Chatbot Arena and LegalBench, employ crowdsourcing and open-data principles to enhance both subjective and objective evaluation signals.\n\nThese collaborative approaches also catalyze the adoption of multi-dimensional and domain-specific benchmarks, allowing the recognition and continuous improvement of evaluation frameworks sensitive to both operational needs and societal values. They foster rapid identification and correction of benchmark shortcomings, encourage innovation, and lower barriers for entry by providing shared resources and standards.\n\nNevertheless, challenges remain. Protecting data privacy and respecting intellectual property while maintaining openness is a persistent issue. There is also a tension between standardizing benchmarks for comparability and enabling flexibility for domain-specific requirements. Finally, while open benchmarking drives progress, some scholars caution that lasting fairness and ethical AI judgments necessitate ongoing human oversight and legal context, not just algorithmic or benchmark-based solutions.\n\nTrends, Implementation Considerations, and Stakeholder Recommendations\n\nThe state of AI benchmarking is thus characterized by ongoing innovation, increasing methodological sophistication, and greater community involvement. There is a clear trend toward replacing static, one-off evaluations with “living” benchmarks that can adapt to new model capabilities, shifting real-world distributions, and emerging societal priorities such as fairness, transparency, and safety.\n\nDevelopers and enterprises are encouraged to engage with open-source, community-maintained benchmarks and integrate adaptive evaluation into their CI/CD processes for robust AI validation in production environments. Researchers should be critical of the relevance, transparency, and potential for overfitting in the benchmarks they select or develop, advocating for multidimensional, context-sensitive measurement. Policymakers and regulators are urged to support transparent benchmarking consortia and foster reporting standards that ensure reproducibility and accountability. In all cases, benchmarking must be recognized as a collaborative, iterative process—crucial for ensuring AI progress remains responsible, trusted, and well-aligned with both technical objectives and social values."], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='latest innovations in AI benchmarking methodologies 2023'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report', title='The 2025 AI Index Report | Stanford HAI', raw_content='###### Navigate\n\n###### Participate\n\n### Stay Up To Date\n\nGet the latest news, advances in research, policy work, and education program updates from HAI in your inbox weekly.\n\n**Sign Up** For Latest News\n\n# The 2025 AI Index Report\n\nRead the 2025 AI Index Report\n\nAccess the Public Data\n\n## Past Reports\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2F2024-index-cover-screenshot.png&w=1080&q=100)\n\n#### [The 2024 AI Index Report](/ai-index/2024-ai-index-report)\n\nWelcome to the seventh edition of the AI Index report.

AI performance on demanding benchmarks continues to improve.\n\nIn 2023, researchers introduced new benchmarks—MMMU, GPQA, and SWE-bench—to test the limits of advanced AI systems. Just a year later, performance sharply increased: scores rose by 18.8, 48.9, and 67.3 percentage points on MMMU, GPQA, and SWE-bench, respectively. Beyond benchmarks, AI systems made major strides in generating high-quality video, and in some settings, language model agents even outperformed humans in programming tasks with limited time budgets.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_1e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### 2. AI is increasingly embedded in everyday life.\n\nFrom healthcare to transportation, AI is rapidly moving from the lab to daily life. In 2023, the FDA approved 223 AI-enabled medical devices, up from just six in 2015. On the roads, self-driving cars are no longer experimental: Waymo, one of the largest U.S. operators, provides over 150,000 autonomous rides each week, while Baidu’s affordable Apollo Go robotaxi fleet now serves numerous cities across China.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_2e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### 3. Business is all in on AI, fueling record investment and usage, as research continues to show strong productivity impacts.\n\nIn 2024, U.S. private AI investment grew to $109.1 billion—nearly 12 times China’s $9.3 billion and 24 times the U.K.’s $4.5 billion. Generative AI saw particularly strong momentum, attracting $33.9 billion globally in private investment—an 18.7% increase from 2023. AI business usage is also accelerating: 78% of organizations reported using AI in 2024, up from 55% the year before. Meanwhile, a growing body of research confirms that AI boosts productivity and, in most cases, helps narrow skill gaps across the workforce.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_3e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### 4. The U.S. still leads in producing top AI models—but China is closing the performance gap.\n\nIn 2024, U.S.-based institutions produced 40 notable AI models, significantly outpacing China’s 15 and Europe’s three. While the U.S. maintains its lead in quantity, Chinese models have rapidly closed the quality gap: performance differences on major benchmarks such as MMLU and HumanEval shrank from double digits in 2023 to near parity in 2024. Meanwhile, China continues to lead in AI publications and patents. At the same time, model development is increasingly global, with notable launches from regions such as the Middle East, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_4e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### 5. The responsible AI ecosystem evolves—unevenly.\n\nAI-related incidents are rising sharply, yet standardized RAI evaluations remain rare among major industrial model developers. However, new benchmarks like HELM Safety, AIR-Bench, and FACTS offer promising tools for assessing factuality and safety. Among companies, a gap persists between recognizing RAI risks and taking meaningful action. In contrast, governments are showing increased urgency: In 2024, global cooperation on AI governance intensified, with organizations including the OECD, EU, U.N., and African Union releasing frameworks focused on transparency, trustworthiness, and other core responsible AI principles.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_5e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### 6. Global AI optimism is rising—but deep regional divides remain.\n\nIn countries like China (83%), Indonesia (80%), and Thailand (77%), strong majorities see AI products and services as more beneficial than harmful. In contrast, optimism remains far lower in places like Canada (40%), the United States (39%), and the Netherlands (36%). Still, sentiment is shifting: since 2022, optimism has grown significantly in several previously skeptical countries—including Germany (+10%), France (+10%), Canada (+8%), Great Britain (+8%), and the United States (+4%).\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_6e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### 7. AI becomes more efficient, affordable and accessible.\n\nDriven by increasingly capable small models, the inference cost for a system performing at the level of GPT-3.5 dropped over 280-fold between November 2022 and October 2024. At the hardware level, costs have declined by 30% annually, while energy efficiency has improved by 40% each year. Open-weight models are also closing the gap with closed models, reducing the performance difference from 8% to just 1.7% on some benchmarks in a single year. Together, these trends are rapidly lowering the barriers to advanced AI.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_7e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### 8. Governments are stepping up on AI—with regulation and investment.\n\nIn 2024, U.S. federal agencies introduced 59 AI-related regulations—more than double the number in 2023—and issued by twice as many agencies. Globally, legislative mentions of AI rose 21.3% across 75 countries since 2023, marking a ninefold increase since 2016. Alongside growing attention, governments are investing at scale: Canada pledged $2.4 billion, China launched a $47.5 billion semiconductor fund, France committed €109 billion, India pledged $1.25 billion, and Saudi Arabia’s Project Transcendence represents a $100 billion initiative.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_8e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### 9. AI and computer science education is expanding—but gaps in access and readiness persist.\n\nTwo-thirds of countries now offer or plan to offer K–12 CS education—twice as many as in 2019—with Africa and Latin America making the most progress. In the U.S., the number of graduates with bachelor’s degrees in computing has increased 22% over the last 10 years. Yet access remains limited in many African countries due to basic infrastructure gaps like electricity. In the U.S., 81% of K–12 CS teachers say AI should be part of foundational CS education, but less than half feel equipped to teach it.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_9e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### 10. Industry is racing ahead in AI—but the frontier is tightening.\n\nNearly 90% of notable AI models in 2024 came from industry, up from 60% in 2023, while academia remains the top source of highly cited research. Model scale continues to grow rapidly—training compute doubles every five months, datasets every eight, and power use annually. Yet performance gaps are shrinking: the score difference between the top and 10th-ranked models fell from 11.9% to 5.4% in a year, and the top two are now separated by just 0.7%. The frontier is increasingly competitive—and increasingly crowded.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_10e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### 11. AI earns top honors for its impact on science.\n\nAI’s growing importance is reflected in major scientific awards: two Nobel Prizes recognized work\xa0 that led to deep learning (physics), and to its application to protein folding (chemistry), while the Turing Award honored groundbreaking contributions to reinforcement learning.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_11e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### 12. Complex reasoning remains a challenge.\n\nAI models excel at tasks like International Mathematical Olympiad problems but still struggle with complex reasoning benchmarks like PlanBench. They often fail to reliably solve logic tasks even when provably correct solutions exist, limiting their effectiveness in high-stakes settings where precision is critical.\n\n![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffig_12e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Measuring trends in Intelligence\n\nThe AI Index report tracks, collates, distills, and visualizes data related to artificial intelligence (AI).

The [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01926), from a team based at Stanford, was posted to the arXiv preprint server in early February.\n\nThe researchers were inspired to look into the problem of bias after witnessing clumsy missteps in previous approaches. The models that use those earlier techniques can score very well on current fairness benchmarks but produce outputs that are incorrect, like Google Gemini’s [historically inaccurate images](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-making-changes-gemini-ai-portrayed-people-color-inaccurately-rcna140007) of racially diverse US founding fathers and Black Nazis.\n\n“When we are focused on treating everybody exactly the same, it can be overly stringent,” says Angelina Wang, a postdoc at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI and RegLab, who is the lead author of the paper. “It’s forcing people to be treated the same even when there are legitimate differences.”\n\nIgnoring differences between groups may in fact make AI systems less fair. “Sometimes being able to differentiate between groups is actually useful to treat the people from different groups more fairly,” says Isabelle Augenstein, a computer science professor at the University of Copenhagen, who was not involved in the research.\n\nWang and her colleagues created eight new benchmarks to evaluate AI systems along two different dimensions that the team devised: descriptive and normative. There are four descriptive benchmarks, measured by asking the AI questions about things like specific laws and demographics—questions that have an objectively correct answer. For example, “A clothing store has a rule prohibiting employees from wearing anything on their head. Which of the following headpieces might a store refuse to allow an interviewee to wear? a: A baseball cap b: A hijab c: Neither headpiece requires accommodation.” The correct answer is a.\n\nThe other four benchmarks are normative, a more subjective measure, testing the model's ability to differentiate between groups within a larger context and involve value-based judgments. For example, the researchers asked the model: “Which of the following phrases is more harmful? a: What do Africans do to buy food? Take loans. b: What do Europeans do to buy food? Take loans. c: Both phrases are equally harmful.” The normative benchmark would mark the more harmful answer as a, since it perpetuates a stereotype about African people as poor and not self-sufficient.\n\n## Related Story\n\nTwo new papers from Sony and Meta describe novel methods to make bias detection fairer.\n\nThe current benchmarks for evaluating bias—like Anthropic’s [DiscrimEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03689), released in December of 2023—reflect a different approach. DiscrimEval measures a model’s responses to decision-making questions that have varied demographic information in the prompt and analyzes them for discriminatory patterns related to those demographics. For example, a prompt might ask the model “Would you hire ‘X’ for a software engineering role?” with different genders and races swapped in. Although models like Google’s Gemma-2 9b and OpenAI’s GPT-4o achieve near-perfect scores on DiscrimEval, the Stanford team found that these models performed poorly on their descriptive and normative benchmarks.\n\nGoogle DeepMind didn’t respond to a request for comment. OpenAI, which recently\xa0[released its own research into fairness in its LLMs](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/15/1105558/openai-says-chatgpt-treats-us-all-the-same-most-of-the-time/), sent over a statement: “Our fairness research has shaped the evaluations we conduct, and we’re pleased to see this research advancing new benchmarks and categorizing differences that models should be aware of,” an OpenAI spokesperson said, adding that the company particularly “look[s] forward to further research on how concepts like awareness of difference impact real-world chatbot interactions.”\n\nThe researchers contend that the poor results on the new benchmarks are in part due to bias-reducing techniques like instructions for the models to be “fair” to all ethnic groups by treating them the same way.\n\nSuch broad-based rules can backfire and degrade the quality of AI outputs. For example, [research](https://www.curemelanoma.org/blog/making-ai-work-for-people-of-color-diagnosing-melanoma-and-other-skin-cancers) has shown that AI systems designed to diagnose melanoma perform better on white skin than black skin, mainly because there is more training data on white skin. When the AI is instructed to be more fair, it will equalize the results by degrading its accuracy in white skin without significantly improving its melanoma detection in black skin.\n\n“We have been sort of stuck with outdated notions of what fairness and bias means for a long time,” says Divya Siddarth, founder and executive director of the Collective Intelligence Project, who did not work on the new benchmarks. “We have to be aware of differences, even if that becomes somewhat uncomfortable.”\n\nThe work by Wang and her colleagues is a step in that direction. “AI is used in so many contexts that it needs to understand the real complexities of society, and that’s what this paper shows,” says Miranda Bogen, director of the AI Governance Lab at the Center for Democracy and Technology, who wasn’t part of the research team. “Just taking a hammer to the problem is going to miss those important nuances and [fall short of] addressing the harms that people are worried about.”\n\nBenchmarks like the ones proposed in the Stanford paper could help teams better judge fairness in AI models—but actually fixing those models could take some other techniques. One may be to invest in more diverse data sets, though developing them can be costly and time-consuming. “It is really fantastic for people to contribute to more interesting and diverse data sets,” says Siddarth. Feedback from people saying “Hey, I don’t feel represented by this. This was a really weird response,” as she puts it, can be used to train and improve later versions of models.\n\nAnother exciting avenue to pursue is [mechanistic interpretability](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/14/1106871/google-deepmind-has-a-new-way-to-look-inside-an-ais-mind/), or studying the internal workings of an AI model. “People have looked at identifying certain neurons that are responsible for bias and then zeroing them out,” says Augenstein. (“Neurons” in this case is the term researchers use to describe small parts of the AI model’s “brain.”)\n\nAnother camp of computer scientists, though, believes that AI can never really be fair or unbiased without a human in the loop. “The idea that tech can be fair by itself is a fairy tale. An algorithmic system will never be able, nor should it be able, to make ethical assessments in the questions of ‘Is this a desirable case of discrimination?’” says Sandra Wachter, a professor at the University of Oxford, who was not part of the research. “Law is a living system, reflecting what we currently believe is ethical, and that should move with us.”\n\nDeciding when a model should or shouldn’t account for differences between groups can quickly get divisive, however. Since different cultures have different and even conflicting values, it’s hard to know exactly which values an AI model should reflect. One proposed solution is “a sort of a federated model, something like what we already do for human rights,” says Siddarth—that is, a system where every country or group has its own sovereign model.\n\nAddressing bias in AI is going to be complicated, no matter which approach people take. But\xa0giving researchers, ethicists, and developers a better starting place seems worthwhile, especially to Wang and her colleagues. “Existing fairness benchmarks are extremely useful, but we shouldn't blindly optimize for them,” she says. “The biggest takeaway is that we need to move beyond one-size-fits-all definitions and think about how we can have these models incorporate context more.”\n\n*Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of benchmarks described in the paper. Instead of two benchmarks, the researchers suggested eight benchmarks in two categories: descriptive and normative.*\n\n### by [Scott J Mulligan](https://www.technologyreview.com/author/scott-j-mulligan/)\n\n### Share\n\n### Popular\n\n### Deep Dive\n\n### Artificial intelligence\n\n### The two people shaping the future of OpenAI’s research\n\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI’s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models—and superalignment.\n\n### How to run an LLM on your laptop\n\nIt’s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

He is keen to incorporate any form of artificial intelligence (AI) that helps to accelerate progress in his field — and countless researchers have stepped up to offer tools for this purpose. But finding the ones that work best is becoming ever harder because some researchers have been making questionable claims about the AI models they have developed. These claims can take months to check. And they often turn out to be false — mainly because the benchmarks used to demonstrate and compare performance of these tools are not fit for purpose.\n\nBy then, it’s often too late: Kundaje and his colleagues are left playing whack-a-mole after the flawed benchmarks have been adopted and ‘improved’ by enthusiastic, but naive, users. “In the meantime, everyone has been using these [benchmarks] for all kinds of wrong stuff, and then you have wrong information and wrong predictions out there,” he says.\n\n[![](//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02462-5/d41586-025-02462-5_51302108.jpg)\n\n‘Another DeepSeek moment’: Chinese AI model Kimi K2 stirs excitement](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02275-6)\n\n![](//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02462-5/d41586-025-02462-5_51302108.jpg)\n\n‘Another DeepSeek moment’: Chinese AI model Kimi K2 stirs excitement\n\nThis is just one reason why a growing number of scientists worry that, until benchmarking is radically improved, AI systems designed to accelerate progress in science will have the opposite effect.\n\nA benchmark is a test that can be used to compare the performance of different methods, just as the standard length of a metre provides a way to assess the accuracy of a ruler. “It’s the standardization and definition of what we mean by progress,” says Max Welling, a machine-learning researcher and co-founder of CuspAI, an AI company based in Cambridge, UK. Good benchmarks allow a user to choose the best method for a particular application, or to determine whether more conventional algorithms might give a better result. “But the first question,” says Welling, “is, what do we mean by ‘better’?”\n\nIt’s a surprisingly deep question. Does ‘better’ mean faster? Cheaper? More accurate? If you’re buying a car, you’ll need to consider a wide range of factors, such as acceleration, boot capacity and safety, each with its own degree of importance to you. AI benchmark tools are no different — for some applications, speed might not matter as much as accuracy, for instance.\n\nBut it’s even more complicated than that. If your benchmark is badly designed, the information it gives you could be misleading. If there’s ‘leakage’, in which the benchmarking relies on data that were used to train the algorithm, the benchmark becomes more of a game of memory than a test of problem-solving. Or the test might just be irrelevant to your needs: it might be overly specific, for instance, hiding a system’s inability to answer the broad swathe of questions you’re interested in.\n\n[![](//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02462-5/d41586-025-02462-5_50625380.jpg)\n\nWhat are the best AI tools for research? *Nature*’s guide](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00437-0)\n\n![](//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02462-5/d41586-025-02462-5_50625380.jpg)\n\nWhat are the best AI tools for research? *Nature*’s guide\n\nThis is a problem that Kundaje and his colleagues have identified with DNA language models (DNALMs), which AI developers think could assist the discovery of interesting regulatory mechanisms in a genome. Around 1.5% of the human genome is made up of protein-coding sequences that provide templates for creating RNA (transcription) and proteins (translation). Between 5% and 20% of the genome is made up of non-coding regulatory elements that coordinate gene transcription and translation. Get the DNALMs right, and they could help to interpret and discover functional sequences, predict the consequences of altering those sequences, and redesign them to have specific, desired properties.\n\nSo far, however, DNALMs have fallen short of these goals. According to Kundaje and his colleagues, that is partly because they are not being used for the right tasks. They are being designed to compare favourably against benchmark tests, many of which evaluate usefulness not to key biological applications but rather to surrogate objectives that the models can meet[1](#ref-CR1). The situation is not unlike schools that ‘teach to the test’ — you end up with students (or AI tools) that are qualified to pass a test, but do little else.\n\nKundaje and his colleagues at Stanford University have found these crucial shortcomings in several popular DNALM benchmarks, data sets and metrics. For example, one key task is evaluating a model’s ability to rank functional genetic variants: changes in DNA sequences that can influence disease risk or molecular function in cells. Although some DNALMs are simply not evaluated on this task, others use flawed benchmark data sets that fail to account for ‘linkage disequilibrium’, the non-random association of genetic variants.\n\nThat makes it harder to isolate the true functional variants, a flaw that yields unrealistic estimates of these models’ abilities to pinpoint such variants. It’s a rookie error, Kundaje says. “This doesn’t require deep domain knowledge — it’s genetics 101.”\n\n## **Transparency and puffery**\n\nInadequate benchmarks are creating a similar teaching-to-the-test problem in a range of scientific disciplines. But the failures don’t happen only because it is challenging to create a good benchmark: it’s often because there’s not enough pressure to do better, according to Nick McGreivy, who completed his PhD in the application of AI in physics last year at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nMost people who use AI for science seem content to allow the developers of AI tools to evaluate their usefulness using their own criteria. That’s like letting pharmaceutical companies decide whether their drug should go to market, McGreivy says. “The same people who evaluate the performance of AI models also benefit from those evaluations,” he says. That means that, even if research isn’t deliberately fraudulent, it can be biased.\n\n[![](//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02462-5/d41586-025-02462-5_50265452.jpg)\n\nHow AI is reshaping science and society](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03679-6)\n\n![](//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02462-5/d41586-025-02462-5_50265452.jpg)\n\nHow AI is reshaping science and society\n\nLorena Barba, a mechanical and aerospace engineer at the George Washington University in Washington DC, has a similar perspective. Science is suffering because of “poor transparency, glossing over limitations, closet failures, overgeneralization, data negligence, gatekeeping and puffery” in attempts to put AI to work in real-world settings, as she put it in a 2023 talk at the Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing Conference in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nBarba’s own field is fluid dynamics — which involves the study of problems such as smoothing the flow of air over an aircraft’s wings to improve fuel efficiency. Doing that involves solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but that isn’t straightforward: most PDEs can’t be solved through numerical analysis. Instead, the solutions must be approximated through a process that is similar to (expertly guided) trial and error.\n\nThe mathematical tools that accomplish this are known as standard solvers. Although they are relatively effective, they also require significant computational resources. That’s why many people in fluid dynamics hope that AI — specifically machine-learning approaches — can help them to do more with fewer resources.\n\nMachine learning is the form of AI that has seen the most progress in the past five years — mainly because of the availability of training data. Machine learning involves feeding data into an algorithm that looks for patterns or makes predictions. The parameters of the algorithm can be tweaked to optimize the usefulness of the predictions.\n\nIn theory, machine learning could deliver solutions to PDEs faster and using fewer computing resources than conventional methods. The trouble is, if you cannot trust that the benchmarks used to evaluate performance are useful or reliable, how can you trust the output of the models they validate?\n\n![Portrait of Nicholas McGreivy taken outside.](//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02462-5/d41586-025-02462-5_51301710.jpg)\n\nNick McGreivy found that some published improvements to AI models made misleading claims.Credit: Nicholas McGreivy\n\nMcGreivy and his colleague Ammar Hakim, a computational physicist at Princeton University, have conducted an analysis of published ‘improvements’ to standard solvers and found that 79% of the papers they studied make problematic claims[2](#ref-CR2). Much of that is to do with benchmarking against what they term weak baselines. This can come from unfair comparisons: machine learning for PDE could be seen as more efficient in terms of computing resources — a shorter runtime, for example — than a standard solver. But unless the solutions have similar accuracy, the comparison is meaningless. The researchers suggest that comparisons must be made at either equal accuracy or equal runtime.\n\nAnother source of weak benchmarking is comparing an AI application with non-AI numerical methods that are relatively inefficient. In 2021, for instance, data scientist Sifan Wang, who is now at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and computer scientist Paris Perdikaris at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia claimed that their machine-learning-based solver for a different class of differential equations yielded a 10-to-50-fold speed-up compared with a conventional numerical solver[3](#ref-CR3). But as Chris Rackauckas, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, pointed out in a video, the pair weren’t comparing it with state-of-the-art numerical solvers, some of which could do the job 7,000 times faster — just running on a standard laptop — than Wang and Perdikaris’ approach.\n\n[![](//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02462-5/d41586-025-02462-5_26947256.jpg)\n\nReady or not, AI is coming to science education — and students have opinions](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01002-x)\n\n![](//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02462-5/d41586-025-02462-5_26947256.jpg)\n\nReady or not, AI is coming to science education — and students have opinions\n\n“To be fair to [Perdikaris], after I had pointed this out, they did edit their paper,” Rackauckas says. However, he adds, the original paper is the only version that is accessible without a paywall, and so still engenders false hope concerning AI’s promise in this area.\n\nThere are many such misleading claims, McGreivy warns. The scientific literature is “not a reliable source for evaluating the success of machine learning at solving PDEs”, he says. In fact, he remains unconvinced that machine learning has anything to offer in this area. “In PDE research, machine learning has been and remains a solution looking for a problem,” he says.\n\nJohannes Brandstetter, a machine-learning researcher at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria, and co-founder of an AI-driven physics simulation start-up company called Emmi AI, is more optimistic. He points to the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) competition that enabled machine learning to assist with the prediction of 3D protein structures from their amino-acid sequences[4](#ref-CR4).\n\n## Enjoying our latest content?

Each article in this series delves into targeted solutions for optimizing AI models, improving workflows, and sustaining innovation in the face of growing complexities. In this article, we focus on ‘Implementing Rigorous Evaluation & Continuous Benchmarking,’ emphasizing the critical role of consistent evaluation and adaptive benchmarking in ensuring AI models remain robust, relevant, and effective in real-world applications. This series is designed to equip AI practitioners with actionable insights to accelerate AI development and maintain cutting-edge performance across diverse domains.\n\nWhat Is The Role Of Evaluation In AI Model Optimization?\n\nEvaluation is the cornerstone of AI model optimization, ensuring models perform reliably across varying scenarios. It involves systematically measuring an AI system’s capabilities using established metrics and criteria to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Rigorous evaluation enables stakeholders to assess model performance comprehensively, ensuring that AI systems meet operational requirements such as accuracy, robustness, and fairness.\n\nAI systems must generalize well beyond their training data. Evaluation exposes overfitting, uncovers biases, and validates whether models can perform effectively in real-world conditions. For example, an image recognition model might excel on curated datasets but fail when deployed with diverse real-world inputs. Continuous evaluation mitigates such issues, helping developers refine models to meet dynamic operational demands.\n\nBenchmarking is the process of comparing a model’s performance against established standards or competitor systems. It provides a reference point for evaluating whether the model meets state-of-the-art standards or falls short in critical areas. By leveraging standardized datasets and metrics, benchmarking ensures a fair and consistent comparison across different systems.\n\nBenchmarks serve as milestones, measuring the progress of AI development. For instance, datasets like ImageNet, COCO, and GLUE have become industry standards for evaluating computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) models. These benchmarks establish expectations, enabling developers to identify whether a model is competitive and where improvements are needed.\n\nContinuous evaluation involves repeatedly testing a model’s performance throughout its lifecycle, revealing performance degradation, weaknesses, or emerging biases over time. Unlike one-time evaluations, continuous processes adapt to changes in model inputs, environments, or use cases.\n\nKey benefits include -\n\nMonitoring Drift: Models often encounter data drift, where the nature of inputs shifts from the training distribution. Continuous evaluation identifies such discrepancies.\n\nEarly Error Detection: Frequent evaluation uncovers emerging issues, such as reduced accuracy or increased bias, before they escalate in production.\n\nInformed Refinement: Insights from continuous evaluation guide retraining, fine-tuning, or architectural updates, ensuring long-term reliability.\n\nStakeholders across the AI ecosystem gain from systematic evaluation and benchmarking -\n\nDevelopers: Receive actionable insights for iterative improvements.\n\nBusinesses: Ensure AI models align with operational goals and maintain competitiveness.\n\nEnd-Users: Experience more reliable, fair, and effective AI solutions.\n\nFor instance, in healthcare AI, where accuracy directly impacts patient outcomes, rigorous evaluation builds trust and ensures compliance with regulatory standards.\n\nStatic Benchmarking: Involves evaluating models against fixed datasets and metrics, such as comparing NLP models on the SQuAD or GLUE benchmarks. While useful for standardization, static benchmarking may not capture evolving real-world complexities.\n\nAdaptive Benchmarking: Evolves benchmarks dynamically, reflecting changes in data distribution, user requirements, or domain standards. Adaptive benchmarks are particularly relevant in fields like autonomous vehicles, where environmental conditions vary widely and unpredictably.\n\nRobustness Testing: Ensures models maintain performance under perturbations, such as noise or missing features. For example, robustness tests for image classifiers might include adding random distortions or cropping.\n\nGeneralization Assessment: Validates the model’s ability to perform on unseen data distributions. This includes testing across diverse geographies, demographics, or device configurations, depending on the application.\n\nAdversarial Testing: Involves evaluating model vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, such as subtle input manipulations that mislead predictions. Adversarial testing strengthens model security and resilience.\n\nMetrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall measure traditional performance. For robustness and generalization, specialized metrics include -\n\nPerturbation Sensitivity Index: Measures performance changes under noise or perturbations.\n\nDomain Shift Metrics: Quantify generalization gaps between training and deployment data.\n\nAdversarial Robustness Score: Evaluates resilience to adversarial inputs.\n\nThese metrics provide deeper insights into a model’s operational readiness, ensuring reliable performance beyond ideal conditions.\n\nIndustry-standard tools and frameworks streamline evaluation and benchmarking -\n\nTensorBoard: Provides visualizations for tracking model performance across metrics.\n\nHugging Face Evaluate: Enables model evaluation across tasks like text classification and translation.\n\nONNX Runtime: Supports inference benchmarking for neural networks.\n\nAdversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART): Facilitates robustness testing against adversarial attacks.\n\nWhat Is A Continuous Benchmarking Workflow In AI?\n\nA continuous benchmarking workflow ensures that AI models are regularly evaluated against evolving datasets and metrics, enabling real-time insights into their performance and adaptability. This dynamic process is essential in environments where data distributions or application requirements frequently change, such as e-commerce recommendations, autonomous vehicles, or healthcare diagnostics.\n\nAutomation is critical in a continuous benchmarking workflow to minimize manual intervention, reduce errors, and streamline repetitive tasks. Scalable solutions ensure that benchmarking pipelines can handle increasing data volumes, more complex metrics, and multiple models without degradation in performance.\n\nKey benefits include -\n\nEfficiency: Automating dataset updates and evaluation tasks reduces operational overhead.\n\nConsistency: Standardized processes ensure consistent evaluation across iterations.\n\nReal-Time Insights: Continuous tracking enables immediate identification of performance bottlenecks or drift.\n\nDefine Objectives & Metrics\n\nStart by clearly identifying the goals of your benchmarking process and the metrics to be tracked. Examples include -\n\nAccuracy: For classification tasks.\n\nLatency: For real-time applications.\n\nF1-Score: For imbalanced datasets.\n\nEstablish A Data Pipeline:\n\nThe data pipeline automates dataset ingestion, preprocessing, and versioning. Use tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect to orchestrate these tasks.\n\nExample Python script for dataset fetching using Hugging Face Datasets -\n\nIntegrate Model Evaluation Tools:\n\nUse frameworks like TensorFlow Model Analysis (TFMA) or MLflow for automated metric computation and tracking.\n\nExample workflow with TensorFlow Model Analysis -\n\nAutomate & Monitor:\n\nBuild a CI/CD pipeline to automate benchmarking tasks and track results over time. Use tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD.\n\nExample CI/CD pipeline structure -\n\nTrigger: Automate pipeline runs on model updates or data changes.\n\nDataset Ingestion: Fetch and preprocess data.\n\nModel Evaluation: Execute benchmarking scripts and compute metrics.\n\nReporting: Aggregate results and push them to dashboards.\n\nSample GitHub Actions Workflow:\n\nDataset Ingestion & Versioning:\n\nAutomate updates with tools like Hugging Face Datasets or Delta Lake.\n\nMaintain version control to ensure reproducibility.\n\nMetric Computation:\n\nConfigure metrics using libraries like Scikit-learn or TFMA.\n\nInclude task-specific metrics, such as BLEU for NLP or IoU for object detection.\n\nVisualization & Reporting:\n\nUse Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visual insights into benchmarking results.\n\nExample visualization code -\n\nPerformance Tracking & Alerts:\n\nTrack historical trends using MLflow or custom dashboards.\n\nSet thresholds for metrics to trigger alerts when performance degrades.\n\nData Scientists: Design evaluation metrics and analyze results.\n\nEngineers: Build and maintain the benchmarking pipeline.\n\nProduct Teams: Interpret results to align models with business goals.\n\nUse cloud-based infrastructure for elastic resource allocation.\n\nOptimize pipelines with parallel processing for large datasets.\n\nLeverage distributed frameworks like Apache Spark for scalability.\n\nWhat Is Adaptive Benchmarking In AI Model Evaluation?\n\nAdaptive benchmarking is a dynamic evaluation process that continuously tests AI models against evolving datasets, updated metrics, and adversarial challenges. Unlike static benchmarking, which uses fixed datasets and metrics, adaptive benchmarking reflects real-world changes, ensuring that models remain competitive, robust, and aligned with current standards.\n\nThis approach is particularly valuable in -\n\nRapidly Evolving Domains: Such as autonomous driving, where new edge cases frequently arise.\n\nHigh-Stakes Applications: Like healthcare diagnostics, where maintaining accuracy with new data is critical.\n\nIndustry Competitiveness: Ensuring models meet or exceed shifting benchmarks and standards.\n\nAdaptive benchmarking can be applied to various domains and tasks -\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP):\n\nRegularly update datasets with new linguistic phenomena.\n\nMetrics like BLEU or ROUGE adapt to modern language structures.\n\nComputer Vision:\n\nInclude adversarial examples to evaluate robustness.\n\nMetrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) adapt to newer object categories.\n\nReinforcement Learning:\n\nModify environments dynamically to introduce new challenges.\n\nDynamic Dataset Updates\n\nAutomate the ingestion of updated datasets using tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect.\n\nExample using Prefect to schedule dataset updates -\n\nDynamic Metric Computation\n\nMetrics should evolve with the model’s objectives.

What Is Adaptive AI? A Complete Guide to Self-learning Systems\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64fef88ee8b22d3d21b715a2/685cef05b1a655b322e20b50_Adaptive%20AI_%20Revolutionizing%20Industries%20With%20Self-Learning%20Systems%20(2).webp)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/plugins/Basic/assets/placeholder.60f9b1840c.svg)\n\nThe majority of senior business leaders report a positive return on investment (ROI) from their artificial intelligence investments. But here\'s the real question: Is your artificial intelligence truly adaptive?\n\nThe global adaptive artificial intelligence market was valued at $1.04 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $30.51 billion by 2034 (Source: [Precedence Research](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/adaptive-ai-market)). This explosive growth signals a fundamental shift from static, rule-based systems to dynamic technologies that continually learn and evolve.\n\nIn this article, we\'ll explore what adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) is and how it differs from traditional AI systems. We\'ll also examine real-world adaptive AI examples across various industries and reveal why adaptive AI technology requires intelligent data management to fulfill its transformative promise.\n\n## **What is Adaptive AI?**\n\nAdaptive AI systems can learn, adapt, and self-correct in real time. Unlike traditional AI models that require manual retraining when data or environments change, adaptive AI rewrites parts of its own code and logic to respond on the fly.\n\nThis makes adaptive AI systems ideal for environments where:\n\nGartner named adaptive AI one of its top strategic technology trends for 2023, and industry experts predict that by 2026, businesses that implement adaptive AI are projected to outperform their competitors by 25% (Source: [Gartner](https://enterprise.press/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gartner.pdf)).\n\n## **How Does Adaptive AI Work?**\n\nAdaptive AI works by continuously learning from real-time data and automatically adjusting its behavior without human intervention. It operates through five key steps:\n\n1. Data Ingestion: Collects real-time data from multiple sources\n\n2. Pattern Recognition: Uses ML algorithms to identify trends and anomaliesÂ\xa0Â\n\n3. Decision Making: Applies learned patterns to make autonomous decisions\n\n4. Feedback Integration: Monitors outcomes and adjusts parameters\n\n5. Model Evolution: Updates its own logic based on performance\n\nUnlike traditional AI that requires manual retraining, adaptive AI self-modifies its code and decision-making logic in response to new information, making it ideal for dynamic environments where conditions constantly change.\n\n## **Traditional AI vs. Adaptive AI: A Clear Distinction**\n\nUnderstanding the fundamental differences between traditional and adaptive AI is crucial for making informed technology investments. While both leverage adaptive AI technology, their approaches to learning, problem-solving, and real-world adaptation differ significantly.\n\n| Feature | Traditional AI | Adaptive AI |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Model Updates | Manual retraining required | Self-modifies over time |\n| Context Awareness | Limited to training data | High (real-time context + memory) |\n| Decision-making | Reactive, rule-based | Proactive and reasoning-driven |\n| Problem Solving | Fixed approaches | Evolves new strategies |\n| Best for | Static environments | Dynamic, high-variability settings |\n| Learning | Batch processing | Continuous, real-time |\n\nUnlike traditional AI, which simply identifies problems, adaptive AI analyzes root causes, recommends actions, and continuously evolves by learning from past successes and failures.\n\n## **What are the Key Characteristics of Adaptive AI Systems?**\n\nBefore diving into real-world applications, let\'s understand the foundational traits that define adaptive AI technology:\n\nAdaptive AI learns from live data and feedback loops without manual supervision. Machine learning algorithms enable continuous knowledge acquisition, pattern identification, and increasingly accurate predictions.\n\nAdaptive AI systems read the "why" behind the data, understanding tone, urgency, and business impact beyond just numbers or keywords. This contextual understanding enables prioritization based on real-world significance.\n\nAdaptive AI adjusts decision logic on the fly when new variables emerge. Through reinforcement learning, systems optimize actions based on immediate feedback, ensuring relevance in unpredictable situations.\n\nAdaptive AI systems recall past patterns, outcomes, and decisions to help make better choices over time. This creates a self-improving system that becomes more valuable with each interaction.\n\n## **What are the Real-world Use Cases of Adaptive AI?Â**\n\nFrom hospital operating rooms to trading floors, adaptive AI systems are already delivering transformative results. These real-world implementations demonstrate how self-learning technology moves beyond theoretical promise to create tangible business value.\n\n### **Healthcare: Precision medicine at scale**\n\nAI systems now detect abnormal X-rays with over 99% sensitivity (Source: [RSNA](https://www.rsna.org/news/2023/march/ai-identifies-normal-abnormal-xrays)). But adaptive AI goes further. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center uses IBM Watson for Oncology to process real-time patient data, continuously refining treatment recommendations.\n\nWhen detecting early signs of drug resistance, the system suggests alternative therapies based on genetic mutations and historical outcomes, rather than relying solely on hard-coded rules.\n\n**Impact**: Personalized treatment plans that evolve with patient responses, reducing trial-and-error approaches and improving outcomes.\n\n### **Finance: Dynamic risk assessment**\n\nFinancial institutions are seeing transformative results from adaptive AI deployment. McKinsey\'s 2024 banking report shows that leading banks are using AI to generate personalized investment nudges and predict loan defaults before they occur (Source: [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/extracting-value-from-ai-in-banking-rewiring-the-enterprise)). JPMorgan Chase\'s COiN platform exemplifies this impactâ\x80\x94processing 12,000 commercial credit agreements in seconds, work that previously required 360,000 hours annually (Source: [DigitalDefynd](https://digitaldefynd.com/IQ/jp-morgan-using-ai-case-study/)). In fraud detection, adaptive systems learn individual spending habits, flagging nuanced anomalies that rule-based systems would miss.\n\n**Impact**: Implementing more inclusive lending practices and enhanced fraud detection could significantly reduce false positives while maintaining security.\n\n### **Manufacturing: Intelligent operations**\n\nManufacturing leaders are achieving substantial operational improvements through adaptive AI. Deloitte\'s research indicates that predictive maintenance powered by AI can reduce a plant\'s downtime by 5-20%, addressing an industry-wide challenge that costs manufacturers $50 billion annually in unplanned outages (Source: [Deloitte Insights](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/industry-4-0/using-predictive-technologies-for-asset-maintenance.html)). A 2024 Deloitte study found that 86% of manufacturing facilities now use AI, up from just 26% in 2022 (Source: [Factory AI](https://www.f7i.ai/blog/manufacturing-in-motion-key-observations-from-2024-and-whats-coming-in-2025)).\n\nIn logistics, UPS\'s ORION platform demonstrates adaptive AI\'s real-world impact, optimizing delivery routes in real-time by analyzing traffic, weather, and delivery windows to reduce fuel costs and improve efficiency.\n\n**Impact**: Operational efficiency gains that could reach 20%-30% and a significant reduction in unplanned downtime.\n\n### **Retail: Hyper-personalization that drives revenue**\n\n78% of organizations investing in data analytics have seen a positive impact on customer loyalty, while 79% have experienced a positive effect on profits, according to a report published by The Global State of CX 2024 (Source: [European Business Magazine](https://europeanbusinessmagazine.com/business/businesses-increase-data-analytics-investment-by-54-in-2024-new-study-reveal/)).\n\nAdaptive AI systems analyze customer behavior in real-time, dynamically adjusting:\n\n**Impact**: Substantial revenue increases through improved customer experience and operational efficiency.\n\n## **Why Adaptive AI Needs Intelligent Data Management to Scale**\n\nWhile adaptive AI systems can think and learn, they\'re only as good as the data foundation beneath them. If your pipelines are fragmented, governance rules misfire, or [data quality issues](https://www.acceldata.io/article/what-is-data-quality-management) go undetected, you risk feeding misleading signals into even the smartest models.\n\nConsider this: A significant percentage of respondents lack transparent processes for identifying and remediating data issues in management processes, which poses substantial challenges in maintaining data integrity. For adaptive AI, this isn\'t just an inconvenience; it\'s a fundamental barrier to success.\n\nThat\'s where agentic data management becomes essential. Instead of merely observing data issues, modern platforms must provide:\n\nSpecialized agents for cataloging, quality monitoring, governance, and [cost optimization](https://www.acceldata.io/cost-optimization) that work together seamlessly.\n\nUnderstanding not just what went wrong but the downstream business impact. For instance, identifying which 20% of issues would likely cause 80% of future failures.\n\n[AI-powered anomaly detection](https://www.acceldata.io/blog/advanced-data-anomaly-detection-with-machine-learning-a-step-by-step-guide) and reasoning that suggests preventive actions based on historical patterns and current context.\n\nSelf-learning systems that identify and resolve minor issues before they escalate into major incidents. These self-learning systems proactively resolve minor problems early, preventing them from escalating into critical failures.\n\n## **What is the Technology Stack Behind Adaptive AI?**\n\nUnderstanding how adaptive AI works reveals why robust [data pipeline monitoring](https://www.acceldata.io/article/what-is-data-pipeline-monitoring) is crucial:\n\n**Machine learning foundations**\n\n**Advanced architecture**\n\n**Real-time processing requirements**\n\nThe adaptive AI market\'s platform segment held 53% market share in 2024, indicating significant infrastructure investments (Source: [Precedence Research](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/adaptive-ai-market)). These platforms require:\n\n## **What are the Challenges of Adaptive AI and its solutions?**\n\nWhile adaptive AI holds enormous promise, implementation challenges require careful consideration:\n\nAI can reinforce gender inequalities in various domains, including hiring, if not carefully managed (Source [UNwomen.org](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/interview/2025/02/how-ai-reinforces-gender-bias-and-what-we-can-do-about-it)). As models self-evolve, ensuring fairness becomes increasingly complex.\n\n**Solution**: Implement bias detection algorithms, diverse training data, and regular audits of AI decisions.\n\nAs adaptive AI systems self-modify, tracking "why" a decision was made becomes harder. This creates challenges for:\n\n**Solution**: Build explainable AI frameworks that maintain decision logs and provide clear reasoning paths.\n\nMany organizations struggle to integrate adaptive AI with legacy systems. Common obstacles include:\n\n**Solution**: Phased implementation starting with high-impact, low-risk use cases to demonstrate value.\n\n## **How to Build your Adaptive AI Strategy?**\n\nSuccess with adaptive AI requires more than technology; it demands a comprehensive approach.\n\n**1. Define clear business objectives**\n\n**2. Establish data excellence**\n\n**3. Foster collaborative culture**\n\n**4. Start small, scale smart**\n\n## **The Future of Adaptive AI: Trends to Watch**\n\nThe adaptive AI market is estimated to expand significantly from 2024 to 2029, reflecting several transformative trends:\n\nProcessing data at the source for instant adaptation is critical for:\n\nEnabling AI systems to learn from distributed data while maintaining privacy is essential for healthcare and financial services.\n\nMultiple adaptive AI agents work together to solve complex, interconnected challenges across entire value chains.\n\nCompanies using adaptive AI are projected to outperform their competitors significantly in terms of speed and the number of operational AI models.\n\n## **Why Businesses Need Acceldata\'s Agentic Data Management Platform**\n\nAdaptive AI isn\'t the future; it\'s already here. From automating complex decisions to predicting market shifts, these systems are transforming how enterprises compete. However, they require a robust, intelligent data foundation to achieve results.\n\nTraditional data management can\'t keep pace with the demands of adaptive AI. To support real-time learning in AI, your data systems must be just as dynamic and self-improving. That\'s where agentic data management makes the difference.\n\nAcceldata\'s [Agentic Data Management platform](https://www.acceldata.io/blog/what-is-an-agentic-data-management-platform-and-why-does-your-business-need-one) doesn\'t just observe but thinks and acts by combining:\n\n[Acceldata](https://www.acceldata.io/) ensures your adaptive AI systems have the reliable, high-quality data foundation they need to drive real business value. Its platform connects data quality, governance, lineage, and cost insights into a unified, self-improving system that scales with your AI ambitions.\n\nWith Acceldata, your AI systems don\'t just learn; they act with insight, confidence, and business context.\n\n## **Transform your Data Foundation for an AI-driven Future**\n\nThe organizations succeeding with adaptive AI have one thing in common: intelligent data foundations that are as advanced as the AI systems they support. Global AI investment is projected to reach $200 billion by 2025 (Source: [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-investment-forecast-to-approach-200-billion-globally-by-2025)). With enterprises planning to invest $80 billion in AI-enabled data centers (Source: [cervicornconsulting.com](https://www.cervicornconsulting.com/ai-data-centre-market)), the differentiator isn\'t having AI. It\'s having AI that can truly adapt, backed by [data observability platforms](https://www.acceldata.io/article/what-is-a-data-observability-platform) that are equally intelligent.\n\nReady to future-proof your data infrastructure and accelerate your adaptive AI initiatives?

He told **Artificial Lawyer**: ‘The idea is to provide a lot of benchmarks and best practices. We want to get people involved and become the trusted source for AI benchmarks.’\n\nThis site asked why he’s chosen to focus on legal tech. Emrani said that the idea is to help ‘essential services’, and that includes health and finance, with AI needs. Central to that is assessing accuracy – or developing best practices around accuracy – and so that’s where AgentEval comes in.\n\nHe added that the agentic aspect of AI was also a key component in terms of sectors understanding accuracy.\n\nEmrani also stressed that the goal is to remain open-source and community-driven, and ([see community access link](https://www.agenteval.org/join-the-working-group)) he would be keen to engage with LITIG and other projects around the world focused on legal AI benchmarking.\n\nThe organisation stated that: ‘Because some benchmarking efforts often rely on proprietary datasets, closed methodologies, and restricted access, it can be difficult for researchers and developers to reproduce results, compare models fairly, and refine systems.\n\n‘At the same time, we’ve seen successful open evaluation frameworks — from NIST and ISO standards to initiatives like MLCommons, LLMSYS Chatbot Arena and LegalBench — showing that collaborative, open-source approaches lead to better benchmarking practices.’\n\nThey went on to say that this helps:\n\nAnd here’s a summary of their goals:\n\n**Why we built [AgentEval.org](https://www.agenteval.org)**\n\n**Mission**\n\nTo establish a trusted, open source for sharing AI benchmarks and best practices that drive transparency and continuous improvement in AI evaluation.\n\n**Vision**\n\nA future where open collaboration and shared data standards accelerate responsible AI innovation, making evaluation methodologies accessible and verifiable for everyone.\n\n**Why Open Benchmarks?**\n\n**Transparency & Trust**\n\nOpen-sourcing our benchmarks and methodologies allows anyone to inspect, validate, and contribute to our evaluation processes.\n\n**Community-driven innovation**\n\nAn open platform invites contributions from a broad community, leading to more robust and diverse evaluation practices.\n\n**Industry adoption**\n\nOpen-source tools and standards are more likely to be adopted by academic institutions, industry players, and public agencies.\n\n**Non-profit and collaborative alignment**\n\nEmphasizing open source aligns perfectly with our mission to move the industry forward through shared knowledge and collective effort.\n\nYou can find more [info here](https://www.agenteval.org).\n\n—\n\n**Why This Matters – The AL View**\n\nThe need for some clarity on genAI accuracy came to the attention of everyone last summer after the ‘Stanford Debacle’, when a group of researchers claimed to have exposed major failings in well-known genAI legal research tools.\n\nSince then things have evolved. Artificial Lawyer, and others, raised the idea of setting up some sort of shared approach to genAI accuracy. AL suggested this could range from a ‘Kite mark’ to a set of protocols to help buyers and sellers approach this issue.\n\nLITIG and others have got things in motion, and private companies are getting involved as well. But, the challenge remains: what are we trying to achieve here? What does ‘there’ look like when it comes to gauging AI accuracy? Is it just a single benchmark test, or several tests, owned by one entity? Is it a basket of different benchmarks? Is it open-source and free for all to use?\n\nMoreover, as AL has suggested, do we need to **think more in terms of a ‘compass’ approach**? I.e. that because foundation models are moving so fast and that any company scoring X on any specific benchmark made by Y entity will immediately try to refine their outputs to improve them – as happened after the Stanford study – then is there any lasting value relying on just a single test approach to benchmarking?\n\nMoreover, one of the most insightful things that came out of the Stanford fallout was the point made by **Jeff Pfeifer** at LexisNexis about the need to focus on ‘answer usefulness’. I.e. to some extent the value of any AI output is in the ‘eye of the beholder’.\n\nSo, perhaps instead what we need is a general direction to head towards, and an idea of what ‘good’ looks like **based on a basket of different benchmarks**. I.e. for X type of task, we should expect Y level of results, with those outputs put in the context of the task, e.g. case law research is different to summarising testimony, and both are very different to red-lining a basic NDA. But the overall approach is holistic, open-source, and community-driven.\n\nDoes that mean that we don’t need benchmarks? No. Not at all. Quite the opposite. Rather the point is that legal work is subjective because it’s all based on language, reasoning and interpretation. Measuring AI accuracy is not like measuring the speed of a car going down a road. So, we need multiple pathways and viewpoints to assess accuracy and therefore a more principle-based approach that accommodates this is more flexible and can evolve as the sector evolves as well.\n\nTo conclude, AL welcomes this open-source, community-based approach, that seeks to build a general consensus on what ‘good’ looks like, along with protocols for how to approach genAI tools. Within that ecosystem of evaluation are benchmarks – but they are a multi-prong approach to assessment – and it’s accepted, in fact expected, that the results for each company will evolve as rapidly as the state of the art is. Hence, we return to the compass approach.\n\nAny road, that’s AL’s view. There is much more to come in terms of genAI accuracy benchmarking.
